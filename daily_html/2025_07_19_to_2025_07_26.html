            <p class="paper-summary">We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at
https://github.com/open-compass/MMBench-GUI.</p>

neural implicit (Neural Radiance Field -- NeRF) and explicit representations
(3D Gaussian Splatting -- 3DGS) in SLAM systems through more comprehensive
scene representations. Purposely, we rely on a Scene Structure Encoder (SSE)
that enriches DINO features into Enhanced DINO ones (EDINO) to capture
hierarchical scene elements and their structural relationships. Building upon
it, we propose two foundational paradigms for NeRF and 3DGS SLAM systems
integrating EDINO features. Our DINO-informed pipelines achieve superior
performance on the Replica, ScanNet, and TUM compared to state-of-the-art

            <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #64748b; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; font-style: italic;">

            <p class="paper-summary">Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.</p>

visual field features, such as lines and boundaries, is critical for reliable
pose estimation. This paper presents a lightweight and efficient method for
detecting soccer field lines using the ELSED algorithm, extended with a
classification step that analyzes RGB color transitions to identify lines
belonging to the field. We introduce a pipeline based on Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) for threshold calibration to optimize detection performance,
requiring only a small number of annotated samples. Our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art deep learning model while offering
higher processing speed, making it well-suited for real-time applications on

            <p class="paper-summary">Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for scalable auto-labeling. Project Page:

            <p class="paper-summary">The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.</p>

tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in
high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into
structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low
signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge
problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review
examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated
particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,
CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias
(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In
cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous
missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines
subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow
culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like
ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into
interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved
near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,
resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation
bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV
virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves,
particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future
promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology,
potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture
and function.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.</p>

but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on

aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user

all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.

            <p class="paper-summary">Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.</p>

detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

            <p class="paper-summary">Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The Mumford-Shah (MS) model is an important technique for mesh segmentation.
Many existing researches focus on piecewise constant MS mesh segmentation model
with total variation regularization, which pursue the shortest length of
boundaries. Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a
novel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed
total generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that
the feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise
constant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to
characterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly
introduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures
and getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve
the new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and
comparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that
our method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In
addition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art
techniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,
the quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy
(ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor
accuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance
SAM2 for ART.
  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR
images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt
robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The
resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver
dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without
retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86
MRIs, 37 patients).
  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and
prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),
0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across
tumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in
boundary-sensitive metrics.
  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity
significantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug
offers a robust, efficient solution for tumor segmentation in ART. Code and
models will be released at https://github.com/apple1986/SAM2-Aug.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

            <p class="paper-summary">Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code

            <p class="paper-summary">Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.</p>

animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel
framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face
Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&
Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features
space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Automatic classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can assist
ophthalmologists in devising personalized treatment plans, making it a critical
component of clinical practice. However, imbalanced data distribution in the
dataset becomes a bottleneck in the generalization of deep learning models
trained for DR classification. In this work, we combine global attention block
(GAB) and category attention block (CAB) into the deep learning model, thus
effectively overcoming the imbalanced data distribution problem in DR
classification. Our proposed approach is based on an attention mechanism-based
deep learning model that employs three pre-trained networks, namely,
MobileNetV3-small, Efficientnet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as the backbone
architecture. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available
datasets of retinal fundoscopy images for DR. Experimental results show that on
the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by
the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80%
accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a
mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded
75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the
F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of
95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work,
the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90
million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than
other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is
at par with recently reported works on DR classification.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in automated
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) analysis. However, the efficacy of these
models is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, artifact-free
images. In clinical practice, CMR acquisitions are frequently degraded by
respiratory motion, yet the robustness of deep learning models against such
artifacts remains an underexplored problem. To promote research in this domain,
we organized the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge. We curated and publicly released
a dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 healthy volunteers who performed
specific breathing protocols to induce a controlled spectrum of motion
artifacts. The challenge comprised two tasks: 1) automated image quality
assessment to classify images based on motion severity, and 2) robust
myocardial segmentation in the presence of motion artifacts. A total of 22
algorithms were submitted and evaluated on the two designated tasks. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of the challenge design and dataset, reports
the evaluation results for the top-performing methods, and further investigates
the impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers. All

            <p class="paper-summary">Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Super-Resolution (VSR) has achieved significant progress through
diffusion models, effectively addressing the over-smoothing issues inherent in
GAN-based methods. Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist
in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational
models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world
degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K
super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with
inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a
high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core
innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated
with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and
suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)
combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture
restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing
1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal
guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume
compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS,
SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our
superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.</p>

and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

            <p class="paper-summary">Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two main
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representations lack interaction with their frequency components in
jointly modeling trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose
PatchTraj, a dynamic patch-based framework that integrates time-frequency joint
modeling for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, and employ dynamic patch
partitioning to perform multi-scale segmentation, capturing hierarchical motion
patterns. Each patch undergoes adaptive embedding with scale-aware feature
extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to model both
fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of the two branches are
further enhanced via cross-modal attention, facilitating complementary fusion
of temporal and spectral cues. The resulting enhanced embeddings exhibit strong
expressive power, enabling accurate predictions even when using a vanilla
Transformer architecture. Extensive experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, on the egocentric JRDB dataset, PatchTraj attains significant relative
improvements of 26.7% in ADE and 17.4% in FDE, underscoring its substantial
potential in embodied intelligence.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.</p>

applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The

but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the

Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and
robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The

            <p class="paper-summary">Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.</p>

sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points

            <p class="paper-summary">Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Self-Attention Mechanisms (SAMs) enhance model performance by extracting key
information but are inefficient when dealing with long sequences. To this end,
a photonic Gaussian Kernel Enhanced Transformer (PGKET) is proposed, based on
the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (PGKSAM). The PGKSAM
calculates the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Score (PGKSAS) using
photon interferometry and superposition to process multiple inputs in parallel.
Experimental results show that PGKET outperforms some state-of-the-art
transformers in multi-classification tasks on MedMNIST v2 and CIFAR-10, and is
expected to improve performance in complex tasks and accelerate the convergence
of Photonic Computing (PC) and machine learning.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.</p>

a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection

developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually

and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical

            <p class="paper-summary">Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.</p>

re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive

            <p class="paper-summary">Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective
tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection
capabilities and scalability of underwater cleanup operations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6
(vs. 86.2 on YouTubeVOS 2019 validation set) while maintaining a competitive

            <p class="paper-summary">Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

            <p class="paper-summary">Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

            <p class="paper-summary">Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

            <p class="paper-summary">Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking
either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark
for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical
image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two
state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and
we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the
latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while
MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its
language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this
weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal
that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and
pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where
current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted,
lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger
defences.</p>

deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and
subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security,
misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review
evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing
reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two
core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical
anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of
manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as
visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning
uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and
adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations
through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However,
comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial
robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade
detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap
highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving
threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository
aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our
findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial
resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of

            <p class="paper-summary">We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.</p>

language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural

            <p class="paper-summary">Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable

Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative

pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the

increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.</p>

preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.</p>

multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude

            <p class="paper-summary">Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to all
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using different
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.</p>

into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

            <p class="paper-summary">Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image

            <p class="paper-summary">Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

            <p class="paper-summary">3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

            <p class="paper-summary">In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our

            <p class="paper-summary">Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

            <p class="paper-summary">Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

            <p class="paper-summary">Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting

driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.</p>

research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond

            <p class="paper-summary">Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.</p>

clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology
image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal
pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:
pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision
language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,
while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs
difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address
these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset
containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and
propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification
and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture
image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.
Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine
tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning
quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology
report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation
quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution
outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4%
improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors,
demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing
solutions.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

            <p class="paper-summary">Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.</p>

vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to

enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core

            <p class="paper-summary">Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing

potential in both everyday activities and professional domains. AI agents
equipped with informative guidance can enhance human performance, but
evaluating such collaboration remains challenging due to the complexity of
human-in-the-loop interactions. In this work, we introduce an evaluation
framework and a multimodal dataset of human-AI interactions designed to assess
how AI guidance affects procedural task performance, error reduction and
learning outcomes. Besides, we develop an augmented reality (AR)-equipped AI
agent that provides interactive guidance in real-world tasks, from cooking to
battlefield medicine. Through human studies, we share empirical insights into
AI-assisted human performance and demonstrate that AI-assisted collaboration
improves task completion.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable
performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in
diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical
images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a
promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current
training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven
distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer
training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a
novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a
unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces
a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction
targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention
across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through
pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate
performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The code is available

            <p class="paper-summary">Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities. The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.</p>

resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.</p>

third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our

recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the

introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will

            <p class="paper-summary">Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

            <p class="paper-summary">The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the

            <p class="paper-summary">Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

            <p class="paper-summary">Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (Text Embeddings
Fusion), a novel and efficient distillation method that directly incorporates
the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and distills the teacher
model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing conditional and
unconditional text embeddings using linear operations, TeEFusion reconstructs
the desired guidance without adding extra parameters, simultaneously enabling
the student model to learn from the teacher's output produced via its
sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art
models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the student to closely
mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more efficient sampling
strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference speeds up to
6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image quality at
levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex sampling
approach. The code is publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism to model long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a noise reduction module, which employs a signal differencing
strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the encoder. This
encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance task-relevant
representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically significant regions.
As a result, the architecture achieves improved segmentation accuracy and
robustness, particularly in low-data settings. Diff-UMamba is evaluated on
multiple public datasets, including medical segmentation decathalon dataset
(lung and pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of
1-3% over baseline methods in various segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer dataset for the segmentation of gross tumor volume in cone beam CT,
where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over baseline.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.</p>

efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB

The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art

preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM

            <p class="paper-summary">Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.</p>

three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models

practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D

Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional

with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830

            <p class="paper-summary">Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.</p>

models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states and current stimuli via dual cross-attention mechanisms
that attend to both perceptual information extracted from the stimulus as well
as narrative information provided by high-level summaries of the content. One
core innovation of our approach is the use of sequences of multimodal context
to predict sequences of brain activity, enabling the model to capture
long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and neural responses. Another is
the combination of a shared encoder with partial subject-specific decoder,
which leverages common representational structure across subjects while
accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong performance on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/TextSAM-EUS .</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth
reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect
Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven
reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and
constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle
continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise
range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better
aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse
recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and
constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which
effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without
requiring any additional hardware changes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual

diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment

high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation

            <p class="paper-summary">Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced
technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical
images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear
attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition
in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this
procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in
sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called
Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative
material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into
material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the
spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a
score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.
Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the
sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional
diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the
performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed
DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.
Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised
score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to
be deployed for clinical diagnosis.</p>

models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were

            <p class="paper-summary">Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing Branch-and-Bound (BnB) solver have been demonstrated to
improve the convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various
computer vision tasks. The code is available on

            <p class="paper-summary">Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for
segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the
inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating
training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of
MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the
landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive
benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:
MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these
models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also
introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on
widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess
accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by
any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major
manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,
voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator
achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth
yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training
data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The
evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at
https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights
for ABDSynth.</p>

synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.</p>

performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for
analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor
slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence
across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate
this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for
reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We
address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing
direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial
diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a
coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining
perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data
efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric
consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image
inpainting. Code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future

            <p class="paper-summary">Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine

visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic

sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

            <p class="paper-summary">Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for
modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a
challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for
simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network
compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce
desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,
class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate
that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and
regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.
In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across
diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present
strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates
in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing
hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.</p>

we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion

autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)
and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)
are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise

optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the

Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact
automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small
numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more
effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social
media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study
of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework
includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection
process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and
a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We
demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American
applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu
to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering
effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve
face recognition performance.</p>

that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality

components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally

            <p class="paper-summary">State-of-the-art visual under-canopy navigation methods are designed with
deep learning-based perception models to distinguish traversable space from
crop rows. While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they
require large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world
field deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant
human resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this
challenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during
model training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to
diversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we
hypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to
suboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with
frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we
propose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)
which masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed
around crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level
contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our
extensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that
masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and
significantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual
navigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward
crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and
generalizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction
in prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the
number of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks
to maximize overall performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of
desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to
unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to
adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been
studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains
elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how
different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral
compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of
compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the
representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective
perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,
revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$
robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the
vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -
whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.
Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm
our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities
persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the
emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a
fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and
suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal
data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in
understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks
(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited
vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being
non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models
(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.
This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception
systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case
situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to
either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who
are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in
reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving
systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous
decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the
performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic
situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for
capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe
that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding
capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult

            <p class="paper-summary">Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep
neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various
robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric
losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict
constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly
optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting
ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding
advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging
theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust
loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.
However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced
optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and
applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric
losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario
and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We
rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE
satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric
passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss
framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate classification of articulatory-phonological features plays a vital
role in understanding human speech production and developing robust speech
technologies, particularly in clinical contexts where targeted phonemic
analysis and therapy can improve disease diagnosis accuracy and personalized
rehabilitation. In this work, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework
that combines real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) and speech signals
to classify three key articulatory dimensions: manner of articulation, place of
articulation, and voicing. We perform classification on 15 phonological classes
derived from the aforementioned articulatory dimensions and evaluate the system
with four audio/vision configurations: unimodal rtMRI, unimodal audio signals,
multimodal middle fusion, and contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion.
Experimental results on the USC-TIMIT dataset show that our contrastive
learning-based approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average
F1-score of 0.81, representing an absolute increase of 0.23 over the unimodal
baseline. The results confirm the effectiveness of contrastive representation
learning for multimodal articulatory analysis. Our code and processed dataset

            <p class="paper-summary">Myocardial motion tracking is important for assessing cardiac function and
diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, for which cine cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) has been established as the gold standard imaging modality. Many existing
methods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame
and a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these
methods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield
inconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a
novel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly
incorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and
temporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba
block equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates
the estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion
decoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target
frame, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking
advantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method
learns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without
increasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two
public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and
state-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods. The code is

computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal
structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this
inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal
solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion
model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to
augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a
generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior
Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality
of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over

significant attention in both academia and industry. However, existing datasets
and methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other
autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET,
the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations
collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby
facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well
as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel
cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the
well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves
perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric
and feature levels. Additionally, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the
resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios,
providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging
cross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation

            <p class="paper-summary">Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
mortality among women, despite recent advances in Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) systems. Accurate and efficient interpretation of multi-view mammograms
is essential for early detection, driving a surge of interest in Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-powered CAD models. While state-of-the-art multi-view
mammogram classification models are largely based on Transformer architectures,
their computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of image
patches, highlighting the need for more efficient alternatives. To address this
challenge, we propose Mammo-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Selective
State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven
feature refinement into a unified architecture. Mammo-Mamba extends the
MambaVision backbone by introducing the Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE)
mechanism through its customized SecMamba block. The SecMamba is a modified
MambaVision block that enhances representation learning in high-resolution
mammographic images by enabling content-adaptive feature refinement. These
blocks are integrated into the deeper stages of MambaVision, allowing the model
to progressively adjust feature emphasis through dynamic expert gating,
effectively mitigating the limitations of traditional Transformer models.
Evaluated on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, Mammo-Mamba achieves superior
classification performance across all key metrics while maintaining

            <p class="paper-summary">Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise
occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods
adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible
region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being
affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal
performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage
framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked
Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent
Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask
updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the
computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to
reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to
the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and
outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and
SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under
various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in
enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is
publicly available.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is
fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This
"seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust,
multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the
forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning
framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three
complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to
perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a
prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal
Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly
grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework
achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive
experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,
significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior
methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time
Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving
attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified
framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,
propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only
model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to
semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the
attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable
states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix
multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define
TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global
token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in
unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of
how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is
to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.
While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,
they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.
Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for
benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,
we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD
robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative
nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual
nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion
models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that
outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with
generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study
to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance
shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model
rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be
captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that
evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the
identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding
of model robustness. Project page including code and data:

object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocol. Models were
evaluated on benchmark datasets across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded

clothes-change data, achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-id --
substantially outperforming other methods. ECHO-BID also surpassed other
methods by a wide margin in occluded viewing scenarios. A combination of
increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining underlie
ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-id. Notably, a smaller, but more
challenging transfer learning dataset, generalized better across datasets than
a larger, less challenging one. However, the larger dataset with an additional
fine-tuning step proved best on the most difficult data. Selecting the correct

            <p class="paper-summary">Understanding lane toplogy relationships accurately is critical for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing two-stage methods suffer from
inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads.
To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that
simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology
relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology
understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing
intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This
approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the
element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among
traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally
expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that
knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD)
maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance
even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element
identification, and topology reasoning. Our code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.</p>

relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional
inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR
mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material
estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity
values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer
complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.
Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome
challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key
innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR
material consistency losses. The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR
renderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports relighting, night
simulations, and dynamic object insertions, achieving results that surpass
current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering

            <p class="paper-summary">As surgery embraces digital transformation--integrating sophisticated
imaging, advanced algorithms, and robotics to support and automate complex
sub-tasks--human judgment of system correctness remains a vital safeguard for
patient safety. This shift introduces new "operator-type" roles tasked with
verifying complex algorithmic outputs, particularly at critical junctures of
the procedure, such as the intermediary check before drilling or implant
placement. A prime example is 2D/3D registration, a key enabler of image-based
surgical navigation that aligns intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D
data. Although registration algorithms have advanced significantly, they
occasionally yield inaccurate results. Because even small misalignments can
lead to revision surgery or irreversible surgical errors, there is a critical
need for robust quality assurance. Current visualization-based strategies alone
have been found insufficient to enable humans to reliably detect 2D/3D
registration misalignments. In response, we propose the first artificial
intelligence (AI) framework trained specifically for 2D/3D registration quality
verification, augmented by explainability features that clarify the model's
decision-making. Our explainable AI (XAI) approach aims to enhance informed
decision-making for human operators by providing a second opinion together with
a rationale behind it. Through algorithm-centric and human-centered
evaluations, we systematically compare four conditions: AI-only, human-only,
human-AI, and human-XAI. Our findings reveal that while explainability features
modestly improve user trust and willingness to override AI errors, they do not
exceed the standalone AI in aggregate performance. Nevertheless, future work
extending both the algorithmic design and the human-XAI collaboration elements
holds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching
the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being
significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making
it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and
the code will be at https://maxiuw.github.io/prix.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled
the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to
traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping
completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details
and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread
application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We
introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene
reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and
large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a
residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and
an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained
details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for
detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting
with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus
paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the
residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via
bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize
poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel
technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better
optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local
moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a
divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our
residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit
or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and
tracking on large-scale scenes.</p>

explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object
recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction by providing more
adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation
by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,
state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at
inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their
robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose
D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust
vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text
and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which
naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic
cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and
reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich
cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate
training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss
that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.
Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves
superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few
samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding
unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has
renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial
attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our
work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of
abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes
critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In
this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD
(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages
adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can
efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we
further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs
perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy
offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite
their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,
highlighting their effectiveness.</p>

the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in
specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of
annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which
hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,
an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning
capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the
intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and
leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease
classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis
within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically
aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable
reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,
achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,
surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in
zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling
law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$),
demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance
data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising
effectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features
between 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing
multi-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training
task to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents
the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant
tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in
complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a
Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud
understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)
Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing
the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level
reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions
directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed
point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning
(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus
assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image
modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates
without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large
datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various
downstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and
generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic
point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal
correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing
this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE)
network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the
visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions
include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference
attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise
inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that
dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames,
a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently
captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a
joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to
alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error
optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved
improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with
Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5%

            <p class="paper-summary">To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal
reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing
vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow
their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible
reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading
manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm,
Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal
training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual
reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated
650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves
30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce
SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and
high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA
by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA
surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling
by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both
simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's
potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with
efficient policy learning.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a
separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during
reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,
resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a
static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy
Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward
modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our
method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable
reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format
optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This
enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic
while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified
model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative
reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24
to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,
URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,
achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward
model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model
and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO
presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly
aligned language models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial
computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for
real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant
communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,
limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression
framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation
quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong
temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,
saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.
To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that
encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via
Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise
activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical
justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling
substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate
lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion
establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower
latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On
4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also
uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on
slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.
CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,
and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable
implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at

screening in various public settings. However, challenges such as object
occlusion, variations in the physical properties of items, diversity in X-ray
scanning devices, and limited training data hinder accurate and reliable
detection of illicit items. Despite the large body of research in the field,
reported experimental evaluations are often incomplete, with frequently
conflicting outcomes. To shed light on the research landscape and facilitate
further research, a systematic, detailed, and thorough comparative evaluation
of recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for X-ray object detection is
conducted. For this, a comprehensive evaluation framework is developed,
composed of: a) Six recent, large-scale, and widely used public datasets for
X-ray illicit item detection (OPIXray, CLCXray, SIXray, EDS, HiXray, and
PIDray), b) Ten different state-of-the-art object detection schemes covering
all main categories in the literature, including generic Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), custom CNN, generic transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and
time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and
computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads
to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a)
Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection
performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and
computational complexity analysis. To support reproducibility of the reported

            <p class="paper-summary">Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet
their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning
rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that
it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this
paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is
meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training
with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers
trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate
normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively
modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,
activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of
gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the
normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on
two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its
counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with
vanilla mSGDW.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in
images, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of
downstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue
to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural
damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging
flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference
images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this
paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that
decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,
effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists
mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local
detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive
the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing
global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from
content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning
strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference
image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves
fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the

            <p class="paper-summary">Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for
identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting
anomalies while reducing false positive rates.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to
directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,
the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely
constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies
like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful
strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view
sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we
propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation
framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on
single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core
challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic
views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low
computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical
objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of
innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we
introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that
learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.
Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse
Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views
and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the
views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,
we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted
expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of
VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify humans and objects
within images and interpret their interactions. Existing HOI methods rely
heavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from
visual cues. These annotations are labor-intensive to create, prone to
inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. We
argue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped
potential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior
work has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there
remain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection
framework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively
utilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal
registry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry
incorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction
signatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective
generalization to rare interactions. Additionally, we propose a unique
multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights the contributions of the
visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our DYSCO
surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with
training-based approaches, particularly excelling in rare interactions. Code is

            <p class="paper-summary">Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced
or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and
challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and
disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental
conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for
geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while
classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive
training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.
However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to
hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone
solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework
that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place
recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a
prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then
employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the
most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity
to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple
geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level
(up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in
combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization
systems.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary
object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but
smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain,
revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate
with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers,
fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed
partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing
specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding
DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an
efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity
decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base
model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space.
To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further
propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with
a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant
experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that,
pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms

radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents
CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and
Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT
integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube
current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships
that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is
employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations
from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters.
These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes
in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is
trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong
predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability,
CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and
technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans.

            <p class="paper-summary">The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large
and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)
introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved
diagnostic processes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving
state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a
strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these
methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without
ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world
light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry
changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first
non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a
dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion
with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a
physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints
for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat
scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to
obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera
trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then
refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.
From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle
with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar
environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses
in world coordinates.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal
temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic
modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and
enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have
either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for
practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails
to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely
EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored
Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the
learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation
pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling
capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's
ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on
semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves
the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation. Code released at

            <p class="paper-summary">Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations
of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen
compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling
attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.
However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual
dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally
pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" applies to "zebra" or "shirts" but
not "sky" or "water"), while the same attribute can manifest differently
depending on context (e.g., "young" in "young tree" vs. "young dog"). Thus,
capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet
long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional
Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.
We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the
likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To
enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to
highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features
then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring
better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and
conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional
dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments
on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code

            <p class="paper-summary">Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.</p>

networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would
incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks
like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a
strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this
setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are
selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial
diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate
spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g.,
data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based
active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively
improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based
active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully
supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all

            <p class="paper-summary">The development of X-Ray microscopy (XRM) technology has enabled
non-destructive inspection of semiconductor structures for defect
identification. Deep learning is widely used as the state-of-the-art approach
to perform visual analysis tasks. However, deep learning based models require
large amount of annotated data to train. This can be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this work, we explore active learning (AL) as a potential
solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We identify two unique challenges
when applying AL on semiconductor XRM scans: large domain shift and severe
class-imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose to perform contrastive
pretraining on the unlabelled data to obtain the initialization weights for
each AL cycle, and a rareness-aware acquisition function that favors the
selection of samples containing rare classes. We evaluate our method on a
semiconductor dataset that is compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory
structures composed of logic and memory dies, and demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models are implicit neural scene representation
methods that offer unprecedented capabilities in novel view synthesis.
Semantically-aware NeRFs not only capture the shape and radiance of a scene,
but also encode semantic information of the scene. The training of
semantically-aware NeRFs typically requires pixel-level class labels, which can
be prohibitively expensive to collect. In this work, we explore active learning
as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We investigate
various design choices for active learning of semantically-aware NeRF,
including selection granularity and selection strategies. We further propose a
novel active learning strategy that takes into account 3D geometric constraints
in sample selection. Our experiments demonstrate that active learning can
effectively reduce the annotation cost of training semantically-aware NeRF,

            <p class="paper-summary">In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation
techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing
large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in
meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts
and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter
module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that
integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer
architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating
only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its
hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in
depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in
features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing
strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate
that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and
UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized
FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).
Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization
capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for
assembling lightweight food image.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across
various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging
conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations
encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this
paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder
with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and
double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line
license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate
dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and
blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the
system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network
(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit
variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This
network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.
The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on
the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When
evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to
99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average
recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167
frames per second, indicating strong practical applicability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main
limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such
as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into
others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to
infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most
existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part
segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.
In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a
key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core
components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we
propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially
reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based
on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into
texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module
(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image
generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human
reconstruction. The project page is available at

dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present
CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital
humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape
basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes
suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based
on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the
rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that
closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work
provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon
characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual
character animation. The project homepage is

            <p class="paper-summary">Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in
challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search
across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further
improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors
for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two
progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention
mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,
one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the
one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this
pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce
the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains
of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup
of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient
method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority
in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain
generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive
and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is

            <p class="paper-summary">In the context of Industry 4.0, effective monitoring of multiple targets and
states during assembly processes is crucial, particularly when constrained to
using only visual sensors. Traditional methods often rely on either multiple
sensor types or complex hardware setups to achieve high accuracy in monitoring,
which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial
environments. This study presents a novel approach that leverages multiple
machine learning models to achieve precise monitoring under the limitation of
using a minimal number of visual sensors. By integrating state information from
identical timestamps, our method detects and confirms the current stage of the
assembly process with an average accuracy exceeding 92%. Furthermore, our
approach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection
and visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to
operators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly
monitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making
it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate
pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic
analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks
that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However,
current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained
reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive
chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to
simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at region-of-interest
(ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as
ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI)
classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present
SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both
ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning
capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and
task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for
chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM.
Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through
a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks.
We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI
samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks
validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work
represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced
AI systems for precision pathology.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Mamba has recently gained widespread attention as a backbone model for point
cloud modeling, leveraging a state-space architecture that enables efficient
global sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, its lack of local
inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures
in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point
cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,
a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a
conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,
the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert
space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens
for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent
Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)
module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by
leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This
enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To
further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion
mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences
without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple
benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its
effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical
image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in
cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,
the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated
prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image
segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,
providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)
to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask
results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain
generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully
automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted
Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty
Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module
integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty
distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding
box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with
SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image
embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the
target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive
experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate
the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above
challenges.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Early diagnosis and accurate identification of lesion location and
progression in prostate cancer (PCa) are critical for assisting clinicians in
formulating effective treatment strategies. However, due to the high semantic
homogeneity between lesion and non-lesion areas, existing medical image
segmentation methods often struggle to accurately comprehend lesion semantics,
resulting in the problem of semantic confusion. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Pixel Anchor Module, which guides the model to discover a
sparse set of feature anchors that serve to capture and interpret global
contextual information. This mechanism enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capacity and improves segmentation accuracy within lesion
regions. Moreover, we design a self-attention-based Top_k selection strategy to
further refine the identification of these feature anchors, and incorporate a
focal loss function to mitigate class imbalance, thereby facilitating more
precise semantic interpretation across diverse regions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the PI-CAI dataset, demonstrating 69.73% IoU
and 74.32% Dice scores, and significantly improving prostate cancer lesion
detection.</p>

but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader
application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic
polarization images. The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a
parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets
covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale
photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,
capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both
photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset
collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained
diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an
effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization
properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization

extensive research focusing on how VLMs respond to answerable questions based
on real-world images. However, there has been limited exploration of how these
models handle unanswerable questions, particularly in cases where they should
abstain from providing a response. This research investigates VQA performance
on unrealistically generated images or asking unanswerable questions, assessing
whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge or attempt to
generate incorrect answers. We introduced a dataset, VisionTrap, comprising
three categories of unanswerable questions across diverse image types: (1)
hybrid entities that fuse objects and animals, (2) objects depicted in
unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent
figures. The questions posed are logically structured yet inherently
unanswerable, testing whether models can correctly recognize their limitations.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating such questions into VQA

            <p class="paper-summary">Current exposure correction methods have three challenges, labor-intensive
paired data annotation, limited generalizability, and performance degradation
in low-level computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce an innovative
Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates the need for
manual annotations, offers improved generalizability, and enhances performance
in low-level downstream tasks. Our model is trained using freely available
paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. This
approach does not need expensive manual annotations, thereby minimizing
individual style biases from the annotation and consequently improving its
generalizability. Furthermore, we present a large-scale Radiometry Correction
Dataset, specifically designed to emphasize exposure variations, to facilitate
unsupervised learning. In addition, we develop a transformation function that
preserves image details and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods
[12], while utilizing only 0.01% of their parameters. Our work further
investigates the broader impact of exposure correction on downstream tasks,
including edge detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the
adverse effects of poor exposure on low-level features. The source code and
dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/BeyondHeaven/uec_code.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are employed in many practical image
and video processing pipelines to reduce storage, minimize transmission costs,
and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of millions of viewers. These
models are sensitive to a diverse range of image distortions and can accurately
predict image quality as judged by human viewers. Recent advancements in
generative models have resulted in a significant influx of "GenAI" content on
the internet. Existing methods for detecting GenAI content have progressed
significantly with improved generalization performance on images from unseen
generative models. Here, we leverage the capabilities of existing IQA models,
which effectively capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass
statistical space, to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We
investigate the generalization ability of these perceptual classifiers to the
task of GenAI image detection and evaluate their robustness against various
image degradations. Our results show that a two-layer network trained on the
feature space of IQA models demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
detecting fake images across generative models, while maintaining significant
robustness against image degradations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via
vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised
pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to
boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models
exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to
learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we
investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,
aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data
for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a
synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training
framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge
in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model
lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.
To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the
CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic
specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for
semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation
loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature
space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With
this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both
paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning
increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive
computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by
compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while
preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance
under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations
for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this
work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset
distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes
decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of
quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss
as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable
fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise
storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\times$
greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across
diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our
approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent studies have explored pretrained (foundation) models for vision-based
robotic navigation, aiming to achieve generalizable navigation and positive
transfer across diverse environments while enhancing zero-shot performance in
unseen settings. In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal
Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies
for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas.
Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve
the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an
early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images
via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2)
introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation
representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance.
Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently
labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We
demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse
gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average
improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in
fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two
complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results
advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models.
Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring
significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment with minimal labeled supervision.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing
workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,
particularly in small and medium-sized operations.</p>

framework generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral

supervision to improve accuracy and quality. During the training stage, we
employ the Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) to enhance the
alignment of the generated crown with the margin line. Additionally, a
positional prompt based on the FDI tooth numbering system is introduced to
further improve the accuracy of the generated dental crowns. Evaluation on a

roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled
perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the
contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab
outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by
embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,

generally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class
attribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This
belief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when
increasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of
maintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate
high-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that
creates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy
control of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets
with proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity
consistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different
from others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP
algorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based
pose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more
efficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,
a synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the
size to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets
yield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on
five real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the
CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11
synthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\emph{i.e., 50\%}) in twin
verification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased
than those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future
investigation. Code is available at https://github.com/HaiyuWu/Vec2Face_plus</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes
(Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The quality assessment of AI-generated content (AIGC) faces multi-dimensional
challenges, that span from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic
understanding. Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,
limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To
address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is
proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical
fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are
developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)
is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary
local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The
Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image
correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion
process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then
aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate
outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the
proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high
speed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to
take into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the
requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.
Therefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved
with YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,
network lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the
detection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck
network and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning
rate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the
backbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic
features to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with
small number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of
multi-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect
detection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to
share the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping
convolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which
significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy
of detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve
the detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned
by an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the
model. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of
accuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5
reaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared
to YOLOv8n.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent
modality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive
nature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by
blending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system
integrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face
biometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.
Simulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle
uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris
boundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,
that encompasses landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy,
attention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis, and dynamic
weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence. DOOMGAN achieves
over 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent
thresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%
improved gaze consistency. We also release the first comprehensive ocular
morphing dataset to support further research in this domain.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for
specific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit
image enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor
generalization performance across different tasks, even across different
datasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a
universal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this
work, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of
exposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic
range (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from
public sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure
sequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via
multi-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from
a single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated
MES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image
Contrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it
demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing
image contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even
outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image
quality metrics. The dataset, code and model are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but
suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process
and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies
that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling
time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We
hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts
correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not
consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this
paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a
novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a
single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative
models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates
sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled
approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the
numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using

            <p class="paper-summary">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and
early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly
reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning
framework for both binary and five-class DR classification, leveraging transfer
learning and extensive data augmentation to address the challenges of class
imbalance and limited training data. We evaluate a range of pretrained
convolutional neural network architectures, including variants of ResNet and
EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of
98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity
classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an
AUC of 94.1%, outperforming several existing approaches. Our findings also
demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced
augmentation with transfer learning for high-performance DR diagnosis. The
proposed framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for DR screening,
with potential for deployment in real-world clinical environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial
odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their
limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of
inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and
generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel
convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can
effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion
perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module
called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures
both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from
dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on
the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further
improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),
which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in
the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling
observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new
CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry
(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based
methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by
10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot
learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks.
However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in
federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients.
Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data,
leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized
adaptation of VLMs while preserving model privacy and reducing reliance on
centralized training. To further tackle data heterogeneity, we introduce
personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each
client's unique data distribution, significantly improving local adaptation
while maintaining global model aggregation. Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset
show that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% over standard
LoRA, demonstrating superior adaptation in non-iid settings. FedVLM provides a
scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning VLMs in federated settings,
advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation
platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding.
However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in
e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global
image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to
suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where
product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal
matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not
generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we
propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating
Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent
for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image
representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances
textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach
significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness,
and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the
largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by
15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework
outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in
both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining
object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust
multimodal recommendations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel
classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual
data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object
detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects
across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating
information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching
networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging
spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces
challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with
specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.
Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by
minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include
balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and
handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing
annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other
applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,
and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this
paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable
deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.</p>

advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video

addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where
off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption
generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly
enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing

            <p class="paper-summary">Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown
significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support
diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these
applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built
environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed
imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from
satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of
high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture
the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable
advancements in object detection and representation using visual data,
primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in
computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on
labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep
learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address
these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach
enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building
boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and
embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a
scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from
a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban
planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,
Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,
demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building
footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The
StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video
streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the
reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast
training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our
approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating
the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which
significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further
ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification
strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more
sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining
rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method
protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or
online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream
application such as animation, toonify, and relighting. Please refer to our

            <p class="paper-summary">Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

            <p class="paper-summary">Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern medical imaging technologies have greatly advanced neuroscience
research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across
different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit
substantial heterogeneity, known as "batch effects" or "site effects". These
non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals,
reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the
generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization
aims to eliminate or mitigate such site-related biases while preserving
meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and
consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts,
methodological advances, publicly available datasets, current challenges, and
future directions in the field of medical image harmonization, with a focus on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We systematically cover the full imaging
pipeline, and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition
and reconstruction strategies, retrospective image-level and feature-level
methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. Rather than providing an
exhaustive survey, we focus on representative methods, with particular emphasis
on deep learning-based approaches. Finally, we summarize the major challenges
that remain and outline promising avenues for future research.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms is essential for
effective breast cancer detection, yet it remains a complex challenge due to
subtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity. Many existing AI approaches
fall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting
their clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four
standard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS
scores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone,
combining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual
State Space Models (VSSMs) to capture global contextual dependencies. To
improve robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based
fusion module that dynamically weights information across views, effectively
handling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across
diagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models
against baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and
multi task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently
outperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task,
the shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830.
For the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of
0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.
These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework and
underscore both the potential and limitations of multitask learning for
improving diagnostic performance and enabling clinically meaningful mammography
analysis.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Anomaly detection (AD) identifies the defect regions of a given image. Recent
works have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with
long-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all
classes. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,
we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel
task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline
state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.
Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not
available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a
class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning
setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD
settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain.
In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods
that have access to class labels and the number of classes. In the most
challenging long-tailed online setting, we achieve +0.53% image-AUROC compared
to baselines. Our LTOAD benchmark is released here:

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm
shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning,
interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic
systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical
imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first
visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive
analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic
interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents
a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically
aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming
medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.
Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular
toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology
segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful
regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning
through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including
pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction
behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy
training.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground
object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural
blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe
that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless
interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object
interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for
compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while
ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the
background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two
key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes
MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,
holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated
pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track
action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)
Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware
attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background
consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and
faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first
dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.
Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates
harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and
outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel
framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost
sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for
co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a
sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while
preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue
types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By
enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework
significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating
potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Transforming in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging into a
tool for spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions
requires automated, high-precision semantic segmentation of dynamically
evolving features. However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic
segmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data,
visually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning
architecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change
detection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net
backbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively
utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN
utilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between
physical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ
environmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN
demonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models,
particularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN
achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models
in predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges
several key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis,
advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental
settings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in
recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected
through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and
privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use
of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models
typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common
limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire
synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause
overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we
propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets
generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces
model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and
demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by
emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models
trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of
these benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational
complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.
Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.
Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated
from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,
ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use
unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information
required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection
networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box
and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set
from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and
category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate
task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the
performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on
the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated
approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional
photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due
to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These
challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of
annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning
model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we
examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for
natural images.
  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization,
semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable
cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement
cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which
can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we
introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation
accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we
found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate,
which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset
used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only
achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. In this work, we
address these limitations by introducing anti-aliasing strategies using
FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to significantly improve explanation
quality. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that the modified
$\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and $\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong
predictive performance while providing faithful and artifact-free explanations
suitable for clinical application in multi-class and multi-label settings. Code

            <p class="paper-summary">Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.</p>

Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability

reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we
propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key
modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for
semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module
for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction

complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to

            <p class="paper-summary">Point cloud completion is crucial for 3D computer vision tasks in autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, obtaining clean and complete
point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and
occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on
synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we
tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point
clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness,
we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which
highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions.
Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing
Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM)
that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and
model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper presents DFR (Decompose, Fuse and Reconstruct), a novel framework
that addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively utilizing multi-modal
guidance in few-shot segmentation (FSS). While existing approaches primarily
rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or
dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information
available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate
visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The
DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a
hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via
SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes
audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a
fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across
visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic
interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path
Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from
tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.
Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both
synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in
both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding
background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a
training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the
attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized
image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies
within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model
retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model
properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions,
achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating
its versatility and performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined
object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone
objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in
complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video
segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object
categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object
category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating
room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows
and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning
segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural
language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.
However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain
contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is
inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,
disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as
surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural
phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments
during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of
temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation
that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become
contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal
reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets
would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an
innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present
TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52
samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote
sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior
capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of
high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several
works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.
However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the
quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,
while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for
generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate
distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using
Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs
generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate
these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from
multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,
including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two
VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an
image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP
and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed
the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only
4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches
across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or
even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be
released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Images taken in low light often show color shift, low contrast, noise, and
other artifacts that hurt computer-vision accuracy. Retinex theory addresses
this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and
illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under
changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have
four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;
(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot
perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color
constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the
scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and
illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the
Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face
detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11
percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and
higher reflectance stability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning has significantly advanced building segmentation in remote
sensing, yet models struggle to generalize on data of diverse geographic
regions due to variations in city layouts and the distribution of building
types, sizes and locations. However, the amount of time-consuming annotated
data for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of
increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training
models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city
layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely
replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data
such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and
physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,
incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and
environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited
training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target
environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates
geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building
segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,
with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This
scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with
synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue
in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving
generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive
real-world annotations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring
individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have
traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made
it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated
way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space
(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research
of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet
been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:
PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The
datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn
conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad
visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images
improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled
images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art
models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time
alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods
achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.
However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they
could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate
characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for
future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets
perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This
highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and
research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use
and further development.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing,
have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies
integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local
details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are
limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any
interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer
and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing
A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a
new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model
(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an
attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of
cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the
multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a
two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of
SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and
Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L
achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic
segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting
higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade
Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while
having 40% less parameters. Code is publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.</p>

accuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can
have implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect
different types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the

tailored for a multi-LiDAR and multi-camera sensor suite. This system enables
cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using
a custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method. We test

from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods
typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the
ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We
introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial
Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw
Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and
spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher
model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from
reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature
representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL
captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence
MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid,
non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional
contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart
disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac
function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture
detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D
cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of
myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can
be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its
limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep
learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological
consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based
methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation
(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation
with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes
cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need
for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through
differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous
motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both
topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC
dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep
learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The

            <p class="paper-summary">Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a
classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually
restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To
resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework
for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to
identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.
The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an
extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which
achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.
Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal
attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in
the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality
deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery
localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised
learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at
enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing
that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows,
addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such
as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and
intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis
network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which
employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over
synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers.
Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to
speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall
structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process
incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information
consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing
pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images
with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the
contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale
image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows
significant advantages over other methods. The source code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">When preoperative planning for surgeries is conducted on the basis of medical
images, artificial intelligence methods can support medical doctors during
assessment. In this work, we consider medical guidelines for preoperative
planning of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and identify
tasks, that may be supported via semantic segmentation models by making
relevant anatomical structures measurable in computed tomography scans. We
first derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained
anatomical information, in order to train segmentation models and quantify how
well they are able to find these structures in the scans. Furthermore, we
propose an adaptation to the loss function in training these segmentation
models and through this achieve a +1.27% Dice increase in performance. Our
fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels and the computed tomography scans we
build upon are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16274176.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic
video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer-
and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical
training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust
performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge.
Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has
emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase,
Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the
Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel,
multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic
cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with
unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition,
instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike
existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization
and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of
temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for
biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the
field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware,
context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support
future research in surgical scene understanding.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation
accuracy.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D. Our project page is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range
of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our
progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial
information. Our code is available at

text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow
understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing
to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present
CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with
leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal
a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
impressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs
necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning-based classification of herbarium images is hampered by
background heterogeneity, which introduces noise and artifacts that can
potentially mislead models and reduce classification accuracy. Addressing these
background-related challenges is critical to improving model performance. We
introduce PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10
for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for
segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing
segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and
evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics.
PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with an IoU of
0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. Incorporating segmented images into
classification models led to consistent performance improvements across five
tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score
improvements of 4.15%. Our findings highlight the importance of background
removal in herbarium image analysis, as it significantly enhances
classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on the
foreground plant structures.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical
questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting
with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or
advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying
robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since
participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots.
In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that
enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support
meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112
participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos
from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The
experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise
on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM
reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more
pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human
condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences
the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,
while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.
Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those
without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and
interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative
robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight
the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback,
supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic
systems tailored to diverse populations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from
whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly,
to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based
thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly,
we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity
through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention
mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to
contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various
types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density
modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture
models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$
and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a
concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on
TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than
the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method

            <p class="paper-summary">Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale
RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In
this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the
limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor
environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing
models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping
alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera
calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves
trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We
evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not
only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically
fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various
conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models
for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, especially for

            <p class="paper-summary">Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and
data-efficient diffusion model that offers enhanced flexibility and strong
potential for a wide range of clinical applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, interest in automatic train operations has significantly
increased. To enable advanced functionalities, robust vision-based algorithms
are essential for perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment.
However, the railway sector suffers from a lack of publicly available
real-world annotated datasets, making it challenging to test and validate new
perception solutions in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce
SynDRA-BBox, a synthetic dataset designed to support object detection and other
vision-based tasks in realistic railway scenarios. To the best of our
knowledge, is the first synthetic dataset specifically tailored for 2D and 3D
object detection in the railway domain, the dataset is publicly available at
https://syndra.retis.santannapisa.it. In the presented evaluation, a
state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation method, originally developed
for automotive perception, is adapted to the railway context, enabling the
transferability of synthetic data to 3D object detection. Experimental results
demonstrate promising performance, highlighting the effectiveness of synthetic
datasets and domain adaptation techniques in advancing perception capabilities
for railway environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous
reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural
implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent
challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline
future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving
real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of
sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image
forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been
extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered
regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and
structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack
sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their
practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery
localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and
integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the
DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT
feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much
improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.
Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the
localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,
noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a
pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually
enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net
demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of
distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks</p>

variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,

cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial
objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for
astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency,
object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding
ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset
containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide
celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution
observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated
through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic
development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community,
STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.
Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR)
model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images
from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by
24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our

            <p class="paper-summary">Chinese License Plate Recognition (CLPR) faces numerous challenges in
unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy
where deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis can enhance
clinical assessments.However, existing publicly available OSCC datasets often
suffer from limited patient cohorts and a restricted focus on either diagnostic
or prognostic tasks, limiting the development of comprehensive and
generalizable models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new
histopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both
diagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each
patient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at
x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the
core and edge tumor regions.The Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six
critical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis
(LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE),
and perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically
evaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion
techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our
analysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve
excellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and
81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization
benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3)
Multi-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to
single-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of
balancing multiple tasks in our dataset. To accelerate future research, we
publicly release the Multi-OSCC dataset and baseline models at

            <p class="paper-summary">The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies
of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for
personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400
videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose
HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict
preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and
query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video
highlighting in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly
release the source code of Mamba-OTR to support future research.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that
FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose
accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging
scenarios with extreme pose variations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by
11.44%.</p>

Detection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the
lens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this
paper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and
resolution, affect the performance of state-of-the-art STDR algorithms in
real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under
controlled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST
with PyTesseract. Our findings reveal that resolution and distance
significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less
predictable role. Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing
technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further
demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise
processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones. This work not only
benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions but also lays the
groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. Our contributions aim to
inspire future research in robust, context-sensitive text recognition for

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters,
text-to-image (T2I) generative models are still susceptible to producing
harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious
concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which
aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs
from the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential
external safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly
recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before
real-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often
treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which
limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to
automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.
Unlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly
models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic
prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and
diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve
this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw
inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple
and tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient
optimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long
and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is
validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9
state-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I
models and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">RGB-Thermal (RGBT) multispectral vision is essential for robust perception in
complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

            <p class="paper-summary">Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D
prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.</p>

models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is
essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial
and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain
and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most
existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting
their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the
disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,
they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain
analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework
that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to
enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense
convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency
module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a
novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial
feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines
and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and
AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.</p>

to object detection models trained on conventional datasets. In this work, we
propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its
weaknesses can be impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object
detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation
has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular,
the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand
for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user
intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video
generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,
multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it
challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current
models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of
additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human
pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable
video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical
applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we
provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both
theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by
introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation
models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,
analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the
denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods
based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition
generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

            <p class="paper-summary">With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on
large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads,
demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code and
data are available in https://github.com/vvangfaye/HoliTracer.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have
enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a
single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.</p>

every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite
imagery analysis, However, they remain limited by their narrow focus on
specific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of
datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations
for tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal

object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches
typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as

detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise,
potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing
roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel
Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The
first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals,
followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect
challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are
subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures
in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual

            <p class="paper-summary">Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

            <p class="paper-summary">Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its
application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing
methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient
incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we
propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework
designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update
mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while
selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this
mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that
encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR
simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical
Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable
online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without
overwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an
existing image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and
higher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view
synthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts
by 44\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We present Livatar, a real-time audio-driven talking heads videos generation
framework. Existing baselines suffer from limited lip-sync accuracy and
long-term pose drift. We address these limitations with a flow matching based
framework. Coupled with system optimizations, Livatar achieves competitive
lip-sync quality with a 8.50 LipSync Confidence on the HDTF dataset, and
reaches a throughput of 141 FPS with an end-to-end latency of 0.17s on a single
A10 GPU. This makes high-fidelity avatars accessible to broader applications.

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial but challenging
due to anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric
data. Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art
results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a
Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance
segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key
innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that
enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale
Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via
multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available
benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that
MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of
87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing
leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and
ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and
computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components. Results suggest
that MLRU++ offers a practical and high-performing solution for 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. Source code is available at:

To overcome the limitations of conventional max-pooling, we integrate three

LS-BiorthLattUwU, into a motion-corrected MGU-Net architecture. These modules
use learnable lattice filter banks to preserve both low- and high-frequency

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

            <p class="paper-summary">Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three
benchmark datasets.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL) and radiomics-based
methods, is increasingly used for cancer outcome prediction with PET and SPECT
imaging. However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features
(HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches
remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review
analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or
SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item
framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation
methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including
model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as
accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally
outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and
sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while
fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant
differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common
limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data
(29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI
standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines,
improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration.</p>

applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">User privacy in mobile robotics has become a critical concern. Existing
methods typically prioritize either the performance of downstream robotic tasks
or privacy protection, with the latter often constraining the effectiveness of
task execution. To jointly address both objectives, we study semantic-based
robot navigation in an ultra-low-resolution setting to preserve visual privacy.
A key challenge in such scenarios is recovering semantic segmentation from
ultra-low-resolution RGB images. In this work, we introduce a novel fully
joint-learning method that integrates an agglomerative feature extractor and a
segmentation-aware discriminator to solve ultra-low-resolution semantic
segmentation, thereby enabling privacy-preserving, semantic object-goal
navigation. Our method outperforms different baselines on ultra-low-resolution
semantic segmentation and our improved segmentation results increase the
success rate of the semantic object-goal navigation in a real-world
privacy-constrained scenario.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual object tracking and segmentation are becoming fundamental tasks for
understanding human activities in egocentric vision. Recent research has
benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric
vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However,
these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and
quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and
reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the face
verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical
for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to
computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel
quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion
classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost
modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for
robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference.
Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable
seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on
neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a
real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6\% Top-1 accuracy and
82.4\% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8\% / 81.7\% on the clinical dataset,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair
comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5\,ms
inference latency and 1.7\,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and
energy use by over 94.6\%/98.6\% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing
state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical
analysis in edge environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large
language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently,
diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though
their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where
training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they
significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.
Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation
loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as
implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse
distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed
left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and
derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which
diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not
compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to
the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions
to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current
reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as
hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature
of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally
forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI
Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that
models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface
plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point
rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions
centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment
by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target
regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance
mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.
This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to
dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich
gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.
Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro
benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of
24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides
superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to
unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI
interaction tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs
attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual
processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,
uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how
incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both
efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image
processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both
human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA
robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously
collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as
well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that
incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)
in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated
patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.
Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number
of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions
of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction
from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide
foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,
allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results
show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces
computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks
and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that
human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic
vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p>

of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,

            <p class="paper-summary">Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares
similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis
challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a
strong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs
and XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study
aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and
multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used
for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to
fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid
overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing
critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on
the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on
the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully
highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed
overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and
validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of
pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.
Future work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data,
and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic
reliability and model transparency</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it easier to create realistic fake
profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for
text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of
existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in
detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the
existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate:
42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure,
restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False
Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on
combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness,
followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using
textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based
GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors
such as the one proposed in this study.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

            <p class="paper-summary">Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.</p>

neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.

            <p class="paper-summary">Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly

generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art

            <p class="paper-summary">State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made

            <p class="paper-summary">Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

            <p class="paper-summary">Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.</p>

to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple
IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly
reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The proliferation of MultiLingual Visual Question Answering (MLVQA)
benchmarks augments the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
multi-modal LLMs, thereby enabling them to adeptly capture the intricate
linguistic subtleties and visual complexities inherent across diverse
languages. Despite its potential, the current MLVQA model struggles to fully
utilize its capabilities when dealing with the extensive variety of handwritten
documents. This article delineates HW-MLVQA, an avant-garde VQA benchmark
meticulously crafted to mitigate the dearth of authentic Multilingual
Handwritten document comprehension. HW-MLVQA encompasses an extensive
collection of 1,600 handwritten Pages complemented by 2,400 question-answers.
Furthermore, it provides a robust benchmark evaluation framework spanning three
distinct modalities: text, image, and an integrated image & text modality. To
simulate authentic real-world contexts devoid of ground truth textual
transcriptions, we facilitates a rigorous assessment of proprietary and
open-source OCR models. The benchmark aspires to facilitate pivotal
advancements in multilingual handwritten document interpretation, fostering
innovation and scholarly inquiry within this specialized domain.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.</p>

initiatives in cultural heritage, yet it remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,
uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and
highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The
application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the
discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry
constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra
continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian
primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing
memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a
discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by
encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us
to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity
transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the
computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the
discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete
representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\eg Eikonal
loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and
enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based
consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher
relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding
complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method
outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Surface reconstruction and novel view rendering from sparse-view images are
challenging. Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods struggle with fine
details, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches lack global
geometry coherence. We propose a novel hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance
3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details
of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses
state-of-the-art approaches in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis
on the DTU and MobileBrick datasets. Code will be released at

            <p class="paper-summary">We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We
empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and
instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.
Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic
manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied. More details are

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical image segmentation is crucial for many healthcare tasks, including
disease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of
skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring
patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation
model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on
low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the
generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of
standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking
datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving
state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes
the proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work
advances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical
image analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare
professionals. The code is made publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging
task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address
this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

            <p class="paper-summary">Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but existing
models often assume fixed, high-resolution inputs and degrade significantly
when faced with lower-resolution data in real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we propose RARE-UNet, a resolution-aware multi-scale segmentation
architecture that dynamically adapts its inference path to the spatial
resolution of the input. Central to our design are multi-scale blocks
integrated at multiple encoder depths, a resolution-aware routing mechanism,
and consistency-driven training that aligns multi-resolution features with
full-resolution representations. We evaluate RARE-UNet on two benchmark brain
imaging tasks for hippocampus and tumor segmentation. Compared to standard
UNet, its multi-resolution augmented variant, and nnUNet, our model achieves
the highest average Dice scores of 0.84 and 0.65 across resolution, while
maintaining consistent performance and significantly reduced inference time at
lower resolutions. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of
our architecture in achieving resolution-robust segmentation. The codes are

progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves
superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets. Code is available

            <p class="paper-summary">Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based
on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from
the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning
and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their
advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal
data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in
complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain
vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex
chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic
data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning
data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of
reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training
strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and
Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims
to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable
subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for
improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the
typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft
reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity
in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks
and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental
results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain
methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g.,
GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We report our recent progress towards building generalist robot policies, the
development of GR-3. GR-3 is a large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) model.
It showcases exceptional capabilities in generalizing to novel objects,
environments, and instructions involving abstract concepts. Furthermore, it can
be efficiently fine-tuned with minimal human trajectory data, enabling rapid
and cost-effective adaptation to new settings. GR-3 also excels in handling
long-horizon and dexterous tasks, including those requiring bi-manual
manipulation and mobile movement, showcasing robust and reliable performance.
These capabilities are achieved through a multi-faceted training recipe that
includes co-training with web-scale vision-language data, efficient fine-tuning
from human trajectory data collected via VR devices, and effective imitation
learning with robot trajectory data. In addition, we introduce ByteMini, a
versatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with exceptional flexibility and
reliability, capable of accomplishing a wide range of tasks when integrated
with GR-3. Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the
state-of-the-art baseline method, $\pi_0$, on a wide variety of challenging
tasks. We hope GR-3 can serve as a step towards building generalist robots
capable of assisting humans in daily life.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">After a family murder in rural Germany, authorities failed to locate the
suspect in a vast forest despite a massive search. To aid the search, a
research aircraft captured high-resolution aerial imagery. Due to dense
vegetation obscuring small clues, automated analysis was ineffective, prompting
a crowd-search initiative. This effort produced a unique dataset of labeled,
hard-to-detect anomalies under occluded, real-world conditions. It can serve as
a benchmark for improving anomaly detection approaches in complex forest
environments, supporting manhunts and rescue operations. Initial benchmark
tests showed existing methods performed poorly, highlighting the need for
context-aware approaches. The dataset is openly accessible for offline
processing. An additional interactive web interface supports online viewing and
dynamic growth by allowing users to annotate and submit new findings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Enabling efficient text-video retrieval on edge-end devices is critical for
real-world applications. Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in
balancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods
ensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while
salient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic
frame selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose
ProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with
significantly improved efficiency. We design a prompt-aware frame sampling
strategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual
prompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of
existing salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic
selection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy
that combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered
fine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving
accuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency
reduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e.,
R@1=49.0 in MSR-VTT dataset. Code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency
domain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in
medical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for
robust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose
DeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel
framework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse
spatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a
Decoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from
different MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction,
and a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet,
enabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion
characteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On
a six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1
accuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external
validation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On
a spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification
task, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal
and external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that
both DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over
10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the
potential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion
classification in multi-sequence medical imaging.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Surface defect detection of steel, especially the recognition of multi-scale
defects, has always been a major challenge in industrial manufacturing. Steel
surfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the
accuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex
environments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of
insufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small
target defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection
framework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the
C3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve
detection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to
reduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing
the spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to
enhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant
computations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,
the CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps
in a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures
detailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher accuracy and robustness in
steel surface defect detection tasks compared to other methods, effectively
addressing defect detection problems.</p>

real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits
object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware
framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual
objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs,
enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically
grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID
encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We
show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks,
but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene
editing. Project page: https://ruijiezhu94.github.io/ObjectGS_page</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels
presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic
disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but
they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow
recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this
work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for
hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We
develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates
local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a
disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which
infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances
are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement
learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during
lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time
disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract
transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe
wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time
flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in
aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on
the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,
circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and
fluid dynamics.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER
demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

            <p class="paper-summary">Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized
fine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in
preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this
work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented
as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for
achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a
partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the
shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within
the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending
algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a
progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate
blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited
version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing
the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques
across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original
shape and also adherence to the textual description.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most
informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in
resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which
focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the
learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of
Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that
characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,
coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a
predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the
estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across
different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and
self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes
effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting
full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals
crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the
scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective
strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays
the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of
AL in both research and real-world applications. The code is available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.</p>

problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized

and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction
tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground
segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and
inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our

Unlike traditional diffusion methods requiring iterative denoising, we

The framework demonstrates that controlled synthetic augmentation improves

            <p class="paper-summary">Pavement defect detection faces critical challenges including limited
annotated data, domain shift between training and deployment environments, and
high variability in defect appearances across different road conditions. We
propose RoadFusion, a framework that addresses these limitations through
synthetic anomaly generation with dual-path feature adaptation. A latent
diffusion model synthesizes diverse, realistic defects using text prompts and
spatial masks, enabling effective training under data scarcity. Two separate
feature adaptors specialize representations for normal and anomalous inputs,
improving robustness to domain shift and defect variability. A lightweight
discriminator learns to distinguish fine-grained defect patterns at the patch
level. Evaluated on six benchmark datasets, RoadFusion achieves consistently
strong performance across both classification and localization tasks, setting
new state-of-the-art in multiple metrics relevant to real-world road
inspection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">High-resolution volumetric computed tomography (CT) is essential for accurate
diagnosis and treatment planning in thoracic diseases; however, it is limited
by radiation dose and hardware costs. We present the Transformer Volumetric
Super-Resolution Network (\textbf{TVSRN-V2}), a transformer-based
super-resolution (SR) framework designed for practical deployment in clinical
lung CT analysis. Built from scalable components, including Through-Plane
Attention Blocks (TAB) and Swin Transformer V2 -- our model effectively
reconstructs fine anatomical details in low-dose CT volumes and integrates
seamlessly with downstream analysis pipelines. We evaluate its effectiveness on
three critical lung cancer tasks -- lobe segmentation, radiomics, and prognosis
-- across multiple clinical cohorts. To enhance robustness across variable
acquisition protocols, we introduce pseudo-low-resolution augmentation,
simulating scanner diversity without requiring private data. TVSRN-V2
demonstrates a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (+4\% Dice),
higher radiomic feature reproducibility, and enhanced predictive performance
(+0.06 C-index and AUC). These results indicate that SR-driven recovery of
structural detail significantly enhances clinical decision support, positioning
TVSRN-V2 as a well-engineered, clinically viable system for dose-efficient
imaging and quantitative analysis in real-world CT workflows.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.</p>

disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.</p>

applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental
challenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance
in such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense
representation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and
discriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.
Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding

            <p class="paper-summary">Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for
surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the
complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce
EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with
mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic
environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference
Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with
dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while
maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification
(HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores
using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization
despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive
softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that
modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement,
or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force
attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical
scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while
distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow
conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four
different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including
occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.
Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations
demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in
both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness
across challenging surgical conditions. The code, dataset, and video results
are available at https://szupc.github.io/EndoControlMag/.</p>

on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.</p>

reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the
latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that
updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the

work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast
imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model
pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast
concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE
latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings
of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.</p>

on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful

            <p class="paper-summary">Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes
will be released soon in public.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we introduce MeshMamba, a neural network model for learning 3D
articulated mesh models by employing the recently proposed Mamba State Space
Models (Mamba-SSMs). MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large
number of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh
models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,
while achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) provide personalized in-silico cardiac
representations and hold great potential for precision medicine in cardiology.
However, whole-heart CDT models that simulate the full organ-scale
electromechanics of all four heart chambers remain limited. In this work, we
propose a weakly supervised learning model to reconstruct 4D (3D+t) heart mesh
directly from multi-view 2D cardiac cine MRIs. This is achieved by learning a
self-supervised mapping between cine MRIs and 4D cardiac meshes, enabling the
generation of personalized heart models that closely correspond to input cine
MRIs. The resulting 4D heart meshes can facilitate the automatic extraction of
key cardiac variables, including ejection fraction and dynamic chamber volume
changes with high temporal resolution. It demonstrates the feasibility of
inferring personalized 4D heart models from cardiac MRIs, paving the way for an
efficient CDT platform for precision medicine. The code will be publicly
released once the manuscript is accepted.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate representation of myocardial infarct geometry is crucial for
patient-specific cardiac modeling in MI patients. While Late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) MRI is the clinical gold standard for infarct detection, it
requires contrast agents, introducing side effects and patient discomfort.
Moreover, infarct reconstruction from LGE often relies on sparsely sampled 2D
slices, limiting spatial resolution and accuracy. In this work, we propose a
novel framework for automatically reconstructing high-fidelity 3D myocardial
infarct geometry from 2D clinically standard cine MRI, eliminating the need for
contrast agents. Specifically, we first reconstruct the 4D biventricular mesh
from multi-view cine MRIs via an automatic deep shape fitting model, biv-me.
Then, we design a infarction reconstruction model, CMotion2Infarct-Net, to
explicitly utilize the motion patterns within this dynamic geometry to localize
infarct regions. Evaluated on 205 cine MRI scans from 126 MI patients, our
method shows reasonable agreement with manual delineation. This study
demonstrates the feasibility of contrast-free, cardiac motion-driven 3D infarct
reconstruction, paving the way for efficient digital twin of MI.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate segmentation of pheochromocytoma (PCC) in abdominal CT scans is
essential for tumor burden estimation, prognosis, and treatment planning. It
may also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing.
This study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify
configurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed
the nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D
segmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class
schemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived
from adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,
kidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad
body-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested
on 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.
Performance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized
Surface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the
Tumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation
accuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)
annotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%
improvement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.
The TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)
and strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold
cross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1
to 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability. These findings
highlight the value of incorporating relevant anatomical context into deep
learning models to achieve precise PCC segmentation, offering a valuable tool
to support clinical assessment and longitudinal disease monitoring in PCC
patients.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Anemia is a widespread global health issue, particularly among young children
in low-resource settings. Traditional methods for anemia detection often
require expensive equipment and expert knowledge, creating barriers to early
and accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we explore the use of deep
learning models for detecting anemia through conjunctival pallor, focusing on
the CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59
months. The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age and other
demographic data, enabling the development of machine learning models for
accurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone,
known for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and
fine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques and a
cross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accuracy of
0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an F1 score of 0.9773 demonstrating strong
performance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge
devices, we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of
different bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model performance.
Preliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high
accuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370), and F1 Score (0.9377), more aggressive
quantization (INT8 and INT4) leads to significant performance degradation.
Overall, our study supports further exploration of quantization schemes and
hardware optimizations to assess trade-offs between model size, inference time,
and diagnostic accuracy in mobile healthcare applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results
highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous
vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.</p>

persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support,
and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions
neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health
workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled
Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure
patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on
small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage
with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we
integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor
analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with
KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL
and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To
optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8,
reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5
at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data
privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made

(SLAM) loop closure problem is the recognition of previously visited places. In
this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop
closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the
embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the
classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic
visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is
designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an
index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction
quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep
learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is

            <p class="paper-summary">Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and
reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high
computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET
image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep
diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between
diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling
the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a
score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve
computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was
adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The
proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets.
For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested
on amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.
For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one
[$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from
another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction
method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types,
providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET
imaging.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain
identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving
video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce
StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with
learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned
on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building
upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed
modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In
particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the
similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven
poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These
matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating
misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face
embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a
global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a
distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal
layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference
stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization
integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for
enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of
StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly
large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets.
This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor
generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper.
In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step
pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance.
More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a
single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite
datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral
information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only
simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on
full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite
loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for
pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny
model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior
performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized
models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled
engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass
brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards
creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for
pan-sharpening. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) techniques rely on either supervised
in-shop approaches, which ensure high fidelity but struggle with cross-domain
generalization, or unsupervised in-the-wild methods, which improve adaptability
but remain constrained by data biases and limited universality. A unified,
training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open
challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON
framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture
fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment
details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing
with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve
fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM
inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,
ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By
disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias
inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance
across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it
is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment
transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene. Code is available at

coral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset
bias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential
misinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware
AI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to
detect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across
varied underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to
optimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining
competitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100
show that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable
real-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,
uncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven
environmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,
WaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing
efficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing. By
addressing key limitations of AI-driven enhancement, this work contributes to

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in
computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography
(USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered
waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally
intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for
quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative
approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their
effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets
oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a
large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between
theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes
8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million
frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a
comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward
simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,
scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and
extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing
innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in
real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate
efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.</p>

accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent
performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language

in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to
assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.
Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and
evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in
computer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has
significantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high
memory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in
real-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything
(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM
often generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.
Therefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline
curve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the
robust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a
four-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed
to effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the
visual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising
critical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical
utility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential
for FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial
automation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and
efficient edge recognition is crucial.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing
learning-based methods primarily rely on supervised regression with annotated
data without leveraging the inherent geometric properties in physical documents
to the dewarping process. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is
characterized by transforming distorted feature lines into axis-aligned ones.
This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid
geometry in planar documents. In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned
geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we
propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping
difficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned
Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with
human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,
our method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves
18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based
regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods
fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts
(e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating
behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over
image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts
perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic
understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based
Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification
with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address
discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates
manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only
images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts
dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts
containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage
cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to
prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We
demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that
MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical
biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual
context in multimodal regression tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate motion estimation in cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging is
critical for assessing cardiac function and surgical planning. Data-driven
methods have become the standard approach for dense motion estimation, but they
rely on vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth (GT) motion
annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain. To address this limitation,
we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of
cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations.
  Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which
incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained
to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the
generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that
simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle. These
pairs serve as fully annotated data samples, providing optical flow GT
annotations. Our data generation pipeline could enable the training and
validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models, allowing for
substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations.

            <p class="paper-summary">Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent
generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to
downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains
challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer
from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality
isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,
we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that
establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,
enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge
flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early
layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts
through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of
low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific
task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper
alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations
at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain
transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further
introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient
cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate
HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11
benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at:

3D vision. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as Maximum Inlier Count, become
ineffective under extremely low inlier ratios. In this paper, we revisit the
registration result evaluation problem and identify the Decision version of the
PCR task as the fundamental problem. To address this Decision PCR task, we
propose a data-driven approach. First, we construct a corresponding dataset
based on the 3DMatch dataset. Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained
to reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of
traditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to
address this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this
classifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,
existing state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced

by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural
properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence
that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a
context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank
Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes
derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a
shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only
the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching
and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper extends Cross Modal Generalization (CMG) to open-set environments
by proposing the more challenging Open-set Cross Modal Generalization (OSCMG)
task. This task evaluates multimodal unified representations in open-set
conditions, addressing the limitations of prior closed-set cross-modal
evaluations. OSCMG requires not only cross-modal knowledge transfer but also
robust generalization to unseen classes within new modalities, a scenario
frequently encountered in real-world applications. Existing multimodal unified
representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle
this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked
multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI
enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic
semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization.
CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating
modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby
strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set
tasks. Extensive experiments on CMG and the newly proposed OSCMG validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of
attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL
methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide
images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training.
Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating
instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the
bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions
among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various
mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially
overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this
work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability
distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local
interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven}
state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our
approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover,
the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are
interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM
due to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D
reconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that
leverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to
estimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.
We express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit
vector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the
concept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common
line estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM
projection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary
components: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based
on an $\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously
estimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm
and orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an
iterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane
translations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches
have leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation
recovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\ell_2$-based objectives
that are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only
approximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,
can lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR
regimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler
angle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell
Correlation (FSC).</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction showcases advanced
Image-to-3D content creation but requires substantial computational resources
and large datasets, posing challenges to training models from scratch. Current
methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance,
which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds.
To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D
Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using
a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated
point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry
and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS
object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality
reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our
approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and
practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality
outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D
content generation.</p>

Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to learn image representation. However, this representation may
contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper
proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image
classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is
utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based
attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image
representation. Finally, a regional score aggregation strategy is used for
multi-label prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL
VOC 2007 and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of SARL over existing

            <p class="paper-summary">3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information
in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for
embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on
separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D
point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to
train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP
for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D
encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for
feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training
inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal
network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),
significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal
model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the
tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across
modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module
is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and
images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and
introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.
Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the
three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to
the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by
approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection
task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval
tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been
significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art
MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning
principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their
success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely
unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited
generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive
study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding
learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based
embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary
contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we
explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training
strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and
re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked
factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these
discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL
(\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al
via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art
competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings,

the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based

            <p class="paper-summary">Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for
industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often
lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical
self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address
these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based
agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive
X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent
positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,
coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the
Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect
region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in
X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides
the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating
context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,
confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the
SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using
tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,
enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate
diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset
demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection
F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and
trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of
agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) captures cardiac signals from facial
videos and is gaining attention for its diverse applications. While deep
learning has advanced rPPG estimation, it relies on large, diverse datasets for
effective generalization. In contrast, handcrafted methods utilize
physiological priors for better generalization in unseen scenarios like motion
while maintaining computational efficiency. However, their linear assumptions
limit performance in complex conditions, where deep learning provides superior
pulsatile information extraction. This highlights the need for hybrid
approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. To address this, we
present BeatFormer, a lightweight spectral attention model for rPPG estimation,
which integrates zoomed orthonormal complex attention and frequency-domain
energy measurement, enabling a highly efficient model. Additionally, we
introduce Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL), which allows BeatFormer to be
trained without any PPG or HR labels. We validate BeatFormer on the PURE,
UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, demonstrating its robustness and performance,
particularly in cross-dataset evaluations under motion scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the emergence of foundation models for depth prediction has
led to remarkable progress, particularly in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their
outputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation
poses challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address
this, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation
models to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as
they require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,
fine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization
capabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,
we introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth
measurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into
metric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,
thereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation
models while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to
bridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional
computational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the
emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the
fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging
topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not
been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion
states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with
a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the
framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately
designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale
temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion
of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations
for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further
propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges
between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of
body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the
relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an
emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow
architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is
jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing
self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and
achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the
existing methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper investigates the problem of object detection with a focus on
improving both the localization accuracy of bounding boxes and explicitly
modeling prediction uncertainty. Conventional detectors rely on deterministic
bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model
robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement
framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth
distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter
high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a
simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.
Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively
integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further
extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability
of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks. Code

Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video

            <p class="paper-summary">Depth completion is an important vision task, and many efforts have been made
to enhance the quality of depth maps from sparse depth measurements. Despite
significant advances, training these models to recover dense depth from sparse
measurements remains a challenging problem. Supervised learning methods rely on
dense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised
approaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and
photometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is
costly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised
methods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only
sparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training. Unlike
existing methods, our approach eliminates the need for dense depth labels or
additional images captured from neighboring viewpoints. By leveraging the
characteristics of depth distribution, we design novel loss functions that
effectively propagate depth information from observed points to unobserved
regions. Additionally, we incorporate segmentation maps generated by vision
foundation models to further enhance depth estimation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and
industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a
significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both
object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D
scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality
textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout
optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and
inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the
input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets.
Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by
constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene
depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal
alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input.
Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer
distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout
parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains
precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on
multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture
fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages
in scene layout synthesis.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images
is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the
high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,
which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there
is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly
used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.
First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to
learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality
of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,
existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding
annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in
supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.
The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation
of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional
diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices
and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training
process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show
that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.
Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus
enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Image dehazing aims to remove unwanted hazy artifacts in images. Although
previous research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to
improve dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models
often experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world
hazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a
flexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during
testing. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than
recovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network
(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to
source-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to
update dehazing models for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce a Haze-Transfer-Consistency loss and a Content-Leakage Loss to
enhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability. Experimental results demonstrate
that PHATNet significantly boosts state-of-the-art dehazing models on benchmark
real-world image dehazing datasets.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in chart
understanding. However, financial charts, characterized by complex temporal
structures and domain-specific terminology, remain notably underexplored. We
introduce FinChart-Bench, the first benchmark specifically focused on
real-world financial charts. FinChart-Bench comprises 1,200 financial chart
images collected from 2015 to 2024, each annotated with True/False (TF),
Multiple Choice (MC), and Question Answering (QA) questions, totaling 7,016
questions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LVLMs
on FinChart-Bench. Our evaluation reveals critical insights: (1) the
performance gap between open-source and closed-source models is narrowing, (2)
performance degradation occurs in upgraded models within families, (3) many
models struggle with instruction following, (4) both advanced models show
significant limitations in spatial reasoning abilities, and (5) current LVLMs
are not reliable enough to serve as automated evaluators. These findings
highlight important limitations in current LVLM capabilities for financial
chart understanding. The FinChart-Bench dataset is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but
are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an
effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training
quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with
pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However,
existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific
heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with
industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines
complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists
of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures
structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale
quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations,
which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant
is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving
strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream
deployment tools.</p>

such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling
safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,
efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering
significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to
conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation
of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic
tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep
learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will
observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a
textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to
accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame
prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world
scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared
to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike
conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy
computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image
and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,
reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for
applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion
trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often
appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods.
Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in
multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In
this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to
analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of
human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in
social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely
on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal
gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we
introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face
in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that
\textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and
2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods
by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired
cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM
to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more
transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to
enhance defense against deepfakes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image
restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ
significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the
challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual
task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target
image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of
low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing
backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible
integration with various architectures and effective utilization of
task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a
unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across
multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we
extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity.
We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision
tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of
training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited
data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations
through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization,
few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the
model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and
potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general
low-level vision modeling.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in
handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models
for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction
(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to
handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical
aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,
stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can
accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite
tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric
aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of
the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results
show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very
sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with
completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher
computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose
estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and
large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric
complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully
replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,
especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance
but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature.
Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation
under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel
Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates
truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in
each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are
independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.
  Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation
fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.
  In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE
samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and
low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD
achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26
on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant

            <p class="paper-summary">Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from
one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as
continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence
relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network
architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and
have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample
efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static
transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to
sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding
time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend
equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie
subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.
We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:
their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for
moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and
demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant
counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity
generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We
present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect
the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), downsampling operations are crucial
to model performance. Although traditional downsampling methods (such as
maximum pooling and cross-row convolution) perform well in feature aggregation,
receptive field expansion, and computational reduction, they may lead to the
loss of key spatial information in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby
affecting the pixel-by-pixel prediction accuracy.To this end, this study
proposes a downsampling method based on information complementarity - Hybrid
Pooling Downsampling (HPD). The core is to replace the traditional method with
MinMaxPooling, and effectively retain the light and dark contrast and detail
features of the image by extracting the maximum value information of the local
area.Experiment on various CNN architectures on the ACDC and Synapse datasets
show that HPD outperforms traditional methods in segmentation performance, and
increases the DSC coefficient by 0.5% on average. The results show that the HPD
module provides an efficient solution for semantic segmentation tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous
wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and
environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in
this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing
saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing
attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally
prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI
data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient
spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core
components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward
semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained
with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these
designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps
and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient
backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15
percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency
results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent
parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability
practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing
gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical
moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer
semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning
have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two
prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling
indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant
content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses
causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps
through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual
grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option
pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These
refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely
retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion
mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The
integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate
accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and
NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially
enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions
require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a
vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their
irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR
interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture
temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal
framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports
with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and
respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in
critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision
encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through
interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at
each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a
retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy
in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became
radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds
significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions
like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial
and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution
in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights
that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning models often hallucinate, producing realistic artifacts that
are not truly present in the sample. This can have dire consequences for
scientific and medical inverse problems, such as MRI and microscopy denoising,
where accuracy is more important than perceptual quality. Uncertainty
quantification techniques, such as conformal prediction, can pinpoint outliers
and provide guarantees for image regression tasks, improving reliability.
However, existing methods utilize a linear constant scaling factor to calibrate
uncertainty bounds, resulting in larger, less informative bounds. We propose
QUTCC, a quantile uncertainty training and calibration technique that enables
nonlinear, non-uniform scaling of quantile predictions to enable tighter
uncertainty estimates. Using a U-Net architecture with a quantile embedding,
QUTCC enables the prediction of the full conditional distribution of quantiles
for the imaging task. During calibration, QUTCC generates uncertainty bounds by
iteratively querying the network for upper and lower quantiles, progressively
refining the bounds to obtain a tighter interval that captures the desired
coverage. We evaluate our method on several denoising tasks as well as
compressive MRI reconstruction. Our method successfully pinpoints
hallucinations in image estimates and consistently achieves tighter uncertainty
intervals than prior methods while maintaining the same statistical coverage.</p>

intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced
video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)
models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,
existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic
scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal
dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct
VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models
for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of
real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into
10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering
spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other
critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on
InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained
spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally,
fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance
improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for

affecting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, individuals
from lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced
stages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid
conditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a
novel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical
deferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment
with three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully
connected layer as the most versatile methodology. We synthesize adversarial,
low-quality images and use contrastive learning to train the deferral system,
guiding the model to identify out-of-distribution samples that warrant
clinician review. By maintaining diagnostic accuracy on suboptimal images and
integrating critical health data, our system can improve early detection,
particularly in underserved populations where advanced DR is often first
identified. This approach may reduce healthcare costs, increase early detection
rates, and address disparities in access to care, promoting healthcare equity.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural
practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration,
food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing
agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or
regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced
terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we
introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global
Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset
covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex
terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution
images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask
labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and
transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing
datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1)
terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple
domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks,
including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the
GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction
methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level
metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research,
providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis
and cross-scenario knowledge transfer.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce
unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant
updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with
minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves
scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks,
making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other
latency-sensitive applications.</p>

Estimating uncertainty for each prediction (i.e., confidence based on
probability density or quantile) is essential for safety-critical contexts like
human-robot collaboration to minimize risks. However, existing diverse motion
forecasting approaches struggle with uncertainty quantification due to implicit
probabilistic representations hindering uncertainty modeling. We propose
ProbHMI, which introduces invertible networks to parameterize poses in a
disentangled latent space, enabling probabilistic dynamics modeling. A
forecasting module then explicitly predicts future latent distributions,
allowing effective uncertainty quantification. Evaluated on benchmarks, ProbHMI
achieves strong performance for both deterministic and diverse prediction while
validating uncertainty calibration, critical for risk-aware decision making.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and
are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR
models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen
and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a
teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot
abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation
Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt
Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal
knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to
recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.
Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental
Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze
rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed
scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align
rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the
Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively
capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned
multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a
stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,
bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction
bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving
superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further
demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel
tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through
natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models.
Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to
balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains
underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we
propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal
WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust
task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific
accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task
allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch
and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through
internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge
bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the
final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on
multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs
and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains
inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets.
While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial
solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts,
multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this
work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to
support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes
diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real
question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the
dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately
handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments
demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and
efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting
a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a
scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant
implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However,
existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment
between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple
representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To
address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent
space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence
between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale
instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology
representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene
expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional
relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination
pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)
instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening
the alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and
structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal
representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across
diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial
transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art
performance in gene expression prediction. The code and checkpoints will be
released soon.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is
essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study
presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level
food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and
after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models
(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped
dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a
comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a
custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the
task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at
least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment
in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter
counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4
GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more
rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or
viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically
post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,
constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is
pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous
monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for
automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service
environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future
directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce
institutional food waste.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating
represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive
environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video
Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent
enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces
'FST.ai' -- which is developed under the 'R3AL.ai' project, which serves as its
Principal Investigator: r3al.ai -- a novel AI-powered framework designed to
enhance officiating in Sport Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex
task of real-time head kick detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision,
deep learning, and edge inference, the system automates the identification and
classification of key actions, significantly reducing decision time from
minutes to seconds while improving consistency and transparency. Importantly,
the methodology is not limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based
on pose estimation, motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be
adapted to a wide range of sports requiring action detection, such as judo,
karate, fencing, or even team sports like football and basketball, where foul
recognition or performance tracking is critical. By addressing one of
Taekwondo's most challenging scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate
the robustness, scalability, and sport-agnostic potential of 'FST.ai' to
transform officiating standards across multiple disciplines.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical
limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over
cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and
(2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity
present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these
issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed
MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving
efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction
mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch
inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information
with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter
branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain
cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing
in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing
multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy
both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive
experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our
MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object
detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general
and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even
without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T
semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its
generality. The source code will be available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video
synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation
through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved
from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic
media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their
single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately,
making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media
formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel
framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of
synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning
(RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage
Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and
substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging
state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark
comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts
using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and

            <p class="paper-summary">Reconstructing photo-realistic large-scale scenes from images, for example at
city scale, is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Neural rendering
is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from
previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering
methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene
because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed
for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for
reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of
geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view
synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit
use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene
(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,
implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids
explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational
cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the
scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth
information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex
scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is
independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines
geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering
large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than
using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach
can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep
learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific
designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a
streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new
opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting
these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets
for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and
the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose
DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a
Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective
fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike
existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully
exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and
segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)
and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior
performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically
exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and
tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction
applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing,
medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with
facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes
is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose
Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships
among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression
recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are
used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based
on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local
appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.
Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and
integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph
learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic
representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph
convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global
dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition
of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed
Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.
The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%,
respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong
generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and
real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for
practical facial expression recognition applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Processing data at high speeds is becoming increasingly critical as digital
economies generate enormous data. The current paradigms for timely data
processing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing
places resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing
analyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream
processing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource
provisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas
excess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as
threshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance
degrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime
adaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive
machine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that
minimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge
stream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts
the upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a
transfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online
stream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution
adaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains.
Finally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of
operator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource
constraints. The lightweight GRU model for load predictions recorded up to
1.3\% SMAPE value on a real-world data set. It outperformed CNN, ARIMA, and
Prophet on the SMAPE and RMSE evaluation metrics, with lower training time than
the computationally intensive RL models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image
contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering
distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities
increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods
for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize
missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time
while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides
a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All
frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three
publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms
diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,
and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these
results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small
datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN
performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I
translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising
directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis. Code and

            <p class="paper-summary">The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such
as Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational
principle: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how
information flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of
self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural
language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an
affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)
as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based
weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS
defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature
relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this
perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a
single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token
similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise
relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie
in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention
within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several
strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical
foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The remarkable success of pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has led to a
proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge
presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable
pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge
lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the
underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning
dynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely
align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential
nonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a
finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD
proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution
toward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware
decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes
and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned
optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the
differential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively
bridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning
process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised
pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive
performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires
reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D
scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,
particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles
and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and
powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects
using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D
embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that
captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These
relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level
integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for
unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and
question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional
supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,
Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms
strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided
relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Clutter in photos is a distraction preventing photographers from conveying
the intended emotions or stories to the audience. Photography amateurs
frequently include clutter in their photos due to unconscious negligence or the
lack of experience in creating a decluttered, aesthetically appealing scene for
shooting. We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that
provides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We
estimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics
and content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify
clutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes
cluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with
different kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical
novelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment
algorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image
inpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs
missing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies
demonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate
algorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher
quality images within less time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">A fundamental challenge in affective cognitive science is to develop models
that accurately capture the relationship between external emotional stimuli and
human internal experiences. While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in
facial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual
differences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates
the phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit
significant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same
stimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we
hypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN
classifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.
To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling
method to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision
boundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,
constructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis
reveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual
uncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles
in emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using
behavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both
group-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns. Our findings
establish a systematic link between ANN decision boundaries and human
perceptual variability, offering new insights into personalized modeling of
emotional interpretation.</p>

a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a
communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many
people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign
language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the
communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can
properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole
world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have
become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent
studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign
over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser
extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for
everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more
than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will
be used.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial Electroencephalography
(iEEG) are critical biomarkers for localizing the epileptogenic zone in
epilepsy treatment. However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer
from unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require
time-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been
used to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled
datasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized
expertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low
inter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across
institutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological
HFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we
leverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant
signals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the
Self-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of
candidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of
pathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for
morphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the
detected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision
for pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine
detection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on
large multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and
clinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy
detectors.</p>

AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical
requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly
demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and
professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA
methods demonstrate stronger perceptual and generalization capabilities
compared to traditional approaches, yet they suffer from modality bias
(score-only or text-only) and lack fine-grained attribute decomposition,
thereby failing to support further aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we
present:(1) ArtiMuse, an innovative MLLM-based IAA model with Joint Scoring and
Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first
expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main
categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with
8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score. Both the model and

            <p class="paper-summary">Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling
and pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space
by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection
accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low
precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D
annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To
eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we
propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for
consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.
Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting
achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded
scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.
Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise
during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.
Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians
and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting. Code is
available on the \href{https://jiahao-ma.github.io/DCHM/}{project page}.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we formulate the knowledge distillation (KD) as a conditional
generative problem and propose the \textit{Generative Distribution Distillation
(GenDD)} framework. A naive \textit{GenDD} baseline encounters two major
challenges: the curse of high-dimensional optimization and the lack of semantic
supervision from labels. To address these issues, we introduce a \textit{Split
Tokenization} strategy, achieving stable and effective unsupervised KD.
Additionally, we develop the \textit{Distribution Contraction} technique to
integrate label supervision into the reconstruction objective. Our theoretical
proof demonstrates that \textit{GenDD} with \textit{Distribution Contraction}
serves as a gradient-level surrogate for multi-task learning, realizing
efficient supervised training without explicit classification loss on
multi-step sampling image representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we conduct experiments on balanced, imbalanced, and unlabeled data.
Experimental results show that \textit{GenDD} performs competitively in the
unsupervised setting, significantly surpassing KL baseline by \textbf{16.29\%}
on ImageNet validation set. With label supervision, our ResNet-50 achieves
\textbf{82.28\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in 600 epochs training,
establishing a new state-of-the-art.</p>

heavily on optical flow or explicit depth estimation, our approach exploits the

constraints between normal flow, scene structure, and inertial measurements.
The proposed optimization-based pipeline iteratively performs event
over-segmentation, isolates independently moving objects via residual analysis,
and refines segmentations using hierarchical clustering informed by motion
similarity and temporal consistency. Experimental results on the EVIMO2v2

            <p class="paper-summary">Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000
pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model
(MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous
methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification
using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the
generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent
MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly
into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To
address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA
(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token
compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that
aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,
inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are
forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length
and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that
TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing

challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical
structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning
attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.
However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their
generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented
point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal
retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from
similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature
Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct
reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in
the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced
and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose
a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical
feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input
features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in
generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability
in handling sparse data and unseen categories.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers
(ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on
devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be
calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic
samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global
and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data
quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant
difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the
quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance
degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a
pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).
Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,
effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and
inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the
quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the
full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves
remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par
with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T
with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our
method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces
computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge
devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by
improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in dynamic and perceptually aliased
environments remains a fundamental challenge for long-term localization.
Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame
embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This
paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies
spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,
end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D
convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,
termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term
spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models
directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing
kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,
yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance
shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a
quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative
divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal
aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings
directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint
variations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The dissemination of visualizations is primarily in the form of raster
images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source
code, interactive features, and metadata. While previous methods have proposed
embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval
(VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to
common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing.
To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework
that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data
link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We
propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data
tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for
crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive
chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval
accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis,
demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding
visualization dissemination and information conveyance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of
complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode
planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire
diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework
featuring a Global Expert, a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, and equipped with a
Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall
dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained
on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware
Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty
to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the
Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router,
GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS
outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even
with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate
significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in
Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean. The

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a
research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability
to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is
still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,
quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of
solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by
saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each
tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and
multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel
quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates
spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the
quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a
meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS
video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language
models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific
characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their
reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from
visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique
characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,
the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,
built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K
authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared
images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts
originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of
visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we
introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that
systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by
considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT
achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.</p>

quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to
conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for
streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened
complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues,
we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming.
Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian
deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated
quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and
adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality.
Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the

demonstrated superiority over existing approaches in various aspects, including

            <p class="paper-summary">Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a standard tool for computer vision
tasks such as image classification. However, typical model architectures may
result in the loss of topological information. In specific domains such as
histopathology, topology is an important descriptor that can be used to
distinguish between disease-indicating tissue by analyzing the shape
characteristics of cells. Current literature suggests that reintroducing
topological information using persistent homology can improve medical
diagnostics; however, previous methods utilize global topological summaries
which do not contain information about the locality of topological features. To
address this gap, we present a novel method that generates local persistent
homology-based data using a modified version of the convolution operator called
Persistent Homology Convolutions. This method captures information about the
locality and translation invariance of topological features. We perform a
comparative study using various representations of histopathology slides and
find that models trained with persistent homology convolutions outperform
conventionally trained models and are less sensitive to hyperparameters. These
results indicate that persistent homology convolutions extract meaningful
geometric information from the histopathology slides.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is

            <p class="paper-summary">Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children
worldwide, underscoring a critical need for fast and accurate diagnostic tools.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual
Networks (ResNets) for automatically diagnosing paediatric pneumonia on chest
X-rays. We enhance interpretability through Bayesian Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual
explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the
decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for
clinical AI deployment.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in
terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur
of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models
do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity.
Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to
perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI),
is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical
deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating
these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are
not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they
are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we
take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a
prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a
"Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human
evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics
used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep
feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to
align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions
to mitigate hallucinations.</p>

we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex
documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and
strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various
depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities.
Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is
supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the

            <p class="paper-summary">Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabeled data from
both known and unknown categories by leveraging knowledge from labeled known
categories. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often
overlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,
when processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in
the image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal
feature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention
Focusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by
pruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective
components: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning
(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple
scales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale
importance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module
that integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational
overhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves
up to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal
computational overhead. The implementation code is provided in

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities
but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation
(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically
via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned
with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation
performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class
collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for
vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with
CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's
gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.
We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier
Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75
datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms
entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA
methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more
stable performance across diverse shifts.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Purpose: This study aims to improve 0.55T T2-weighted PROPELLER lung MRI
through a self-supervised joint reconstruction and denoising model.
  Methods: T2-weighted 0.55T lung MRI dataset including 44 patients with
previous covid infection were used. A self-supervised learning framework was
developed, where each blade of the PROPELLER acquisition was split along the
readout direction into two partitions. One subset trains the unrolled
reconstruction network, while the other subset is used for loss calculation,
enabling self-supervised training without clean targets and leveraging matched
noise statistics for denoising. For comparison, Marchenko-Pastur Principal
Component Analysis (MPPCA) was performed along the coil dimension, followed by
conventional parallel imaging reconstruction. The quality of the reconstructed
lung MRI was assessed visually by two experienced radiologists independently.
  Results: The proposed self-supervised model improved the clarity and
structural integrity of the lung images. For cases with available CT scans, the
reconstructed images demonstrated strong alignment with corresponding CT
images. Additionally, the proposed model enables further scan time reduction by
requiring only half the number of blades. Reader evaluations confirmed that the
proposed method outperformed MPPCA-denoised images across all categories
(Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p<0.001), with moderate inter-reader agreement
(weighted Cohen's kappa=0.55; percentage of exact and within +/-1 point
agreement=91%).
  Conclusion: By leveraging intrinsic structural redundancies between two
disjoint splits of k-space subsets, the proposed self-supervised learning model
effectively reconstructs the image while suppressing the noise for 0.55T
T2-weighted lung MRI with PROPELLER sampling.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
prominent keyword because it is promising in solving complex tasks. The need
for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines
have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the
right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help
of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence
technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the
development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In
this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene
understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to
investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of
several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that
choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the
model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation
allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.
In the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,

            <p class="paper-summary">The widespread deployment of cameras has led to an exponential increase in
video data, creating vast opportunities for applications such as traffic
management and crime surveillance. However, querying specific objects from
large-scale video datasets presents challenges, including (1) processing
massive and continuously growing data volumes, (2) supporting complex query
requirements, and (3) ensuring low-latency execution. Existing video analysis
methods struggle with either limited adaptability to unseen object classes or
suffer from high query latency. In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system
designed to efficiently handle comp$\underline{L}$ex $\underline{O}$bject
queries in large-scale $\underline{V}$ide$\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to
user queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained
visual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build
an efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding
boxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector
database, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO
transforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate
nearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal
rerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with
detailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates
that LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with
near-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while
significantly reducing index construction costs. This system redefines the
state-of-the-art object query approaches in video analysis, setting a new
benchmark for complex object queries with a novel, scalable, and efficient
approach that excels in dynamic environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for
domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart
comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First,
they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization
to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for
chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying
data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth
chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data
generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart
types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model
to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning
capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we
establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering
at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a
wide range of chart types. The code and data are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of
taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need
for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To
address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive
dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and
facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In
doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of
state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193
websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail
websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:
SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits
to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial
evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less
than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in
lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying
current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore
investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that
a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in
performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from
20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of
the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must
approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for
diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the
subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current
approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect
localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an
uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a
global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity
and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach
employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding
the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression
mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement
strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate
both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three
CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for
kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial
benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive

Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high

            <p class="paper-summary">Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking</p>

integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single
trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation
function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and
making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The
proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i +
\tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters
$\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our
APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69%
test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters.
The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency

forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown
great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature
and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network
parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their
practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic
imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image
Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces
three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal
Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction
backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal
coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both
simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast
and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT)
reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior
image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in
ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),
highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

nine-channel multispectral input and uses self-attention mechanisms to better
capture subtle, spatially-distributed symptoms. The plants in the experiments
were grown under controlled nutrient stress conditions for evaluation. We carry
out extensive experiments to benchmark the proposed model against the baseline
YOLOv5. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the baseline YOLOv5, with an average Dice score and IoU
(Intersection over Union) improvement of about 12%. In particular, this model
is effective in detecting challenging symptoms like chlorosis and pigment

            <p class="paper-summary">Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of

DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene

module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior

            <p class="paper-summary">Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in AI-powered surveillance have intensified concerns over the
collection and processing of sensitive personal data. In response, research has
increasingly focused on privacy-by-design solutions, raising the need for
objective techniques to evaluate privacy protection. This paper presents a
comprehensive framework for evaluating visual privacy-protection methods across
three dimensions: privacy, utility, and practicality. In addition, it
introduces HR-VISPR, a publicly available human-centric dataset with biometric,
soft-biometric, and non-biometric labels to train an interpretable privacy
metric. We evaluate 11 privacy protection methods, ranging from conventional
techniques to advanced deep-learning methods, through the proposed framework.
The framework differentiates privacy levels in alignment with human visual
perception, while highlighting trade-offs between privacy, utility, and
practicality. This study, along with the HR-VISPR dataset, serves as an
insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high
metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in
melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual
segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer
variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation
methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the
segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach
leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million
histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the
original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder
segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.
The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the
PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.
Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology
foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational
pathology workflows.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual
perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal
architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual
differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity
patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational
principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common
trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its
transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We
introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining
inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this
framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we
reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two
pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal
stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is
captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing
the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a
convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and
artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated
on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to
enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the
transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account
for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying
the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be
impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors
as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that
utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.
By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR
image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then
applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR
reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our
reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind
SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous
methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling
factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the
effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.</p>

according to user-configured anatomies for volumetric upper- and lower-bounds.
It has a knowledge graph-based and time efficient tool for anatomy segmentation
mask management and medical image database maintenance. AnatomyArchive enables
automatic body volume cropping, as well as automatic arm-detection and
exclusion, for more precise body composition analysis in both 2D and 3D
formats. It provides robust voxel-based radiomic feature extraction, feature
visualization, and an integrated toolchain for statistical tests and analysis.
A python-based GPU-accelerated nearly photo-realistic segmentation-integrated
composite cinematic rendering is also included. We present here its software
architecture design, illustrate its workflow and working principle of
algorithms as well provide a few examples on how the software can be used to
assist development of modern machine learning models. Open-source codes will be
released at https://github.com/lxu-medai/AnatomyArchive for only research and

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.</p>

real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.</p>

supervised labelling of safety-critical data, which is often impractical in
real-world settings. Recent advances in world models enable reliable prediction
in latent spaces, opening new avenues for scalable and data-efficient safe
control. In this work, we introduce a semi-supervised framework that leverages
control barrier certificates (CBCs) learned in the latent space of a world
model to synthesise safe visuomotor policies. Our approach jointly learns a
neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data,
while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent
dynamics modelling.</p>

to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.</p>

feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational

enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models

An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across

            <p class="paper-summary">The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.</p>

member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and

from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food

current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling
several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this,
we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which
consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal
product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured

demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety
monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring
activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often
non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences
across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.</p>

treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation

            <p class="paper-summary">Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution
and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We
present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T
brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172
participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish
BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:
a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial
network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art
3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI
professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T
images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due
to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the
amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually
segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images
that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed
similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive
status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic
T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T
images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising
performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use
cases, and limitations are discussed.</p>

enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.</p>

degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision transformer (ViT) models, when coupled with interpretation models, are
regarded as secure and challenging to deceive, making them well-suited for
security-critical domains such as medical applications, autonomous vehicles,
drones, and robotics. However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to
severe consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily
focuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive
the models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model
interpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively
assist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the
vulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined
with interpretation models. We propose an attack called "AdViT" that generates
adversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and
its coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various
transformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that
AdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box
scenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification
confidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76%
misclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate
interpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more
difficult to detect.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

            <p class="paper-summary">Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.</p>

Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such

high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order

screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for
breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical
structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full
range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative
analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation
algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular
tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and
implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these
structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.
Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,
UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among
them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across
all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,
with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All
model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data
at a later date.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.</p>

Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights
from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that
reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored
non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,
and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods
often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single
style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we
advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian
primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style
transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives
tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization
results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian
splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,
extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,
resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced
lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving
flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance
stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing
tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing
with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and
quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its
superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and
editing flexibility.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are

expressivity of facial cues. We evaluate this approach using human annotations

incorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,
offering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to

            <p class="paper-summary">The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet
coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the
local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach
quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by
Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a
distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a
connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise
regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates
for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij
spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in
low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even
for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical
findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of
one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled
time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering
unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training
datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is
particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance
varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent
domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training
deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and
anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation
maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen
during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated
effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond
neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray
microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation,
and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key
benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while
discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the
article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to
accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more
accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or
machine learning knowledge.</p>
