            <h2 class="paper-title">Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings</h2>
            
            <p class="paper-summary">Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large
language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently,
diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though
their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where
training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they
significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.
Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation
loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as
implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse
distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed
left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and
derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which
diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not
compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to
the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:

            <h2 class="paper-title">Latent Denoising Makes Good Visual Tokenizers</h2>
            
            <p class="paper-summary">Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions
to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current
reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as
hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature
of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally
forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI
Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that
models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface
plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point
rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions
centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment
by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target
regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance
mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.
This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to
dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich
gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.
Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro
benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of
24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides
superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to
unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI
interaction tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs
attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual
processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,
uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how
incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both
efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image
processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both
human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA
robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously
collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as
well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that
incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)
in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated
patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.
Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number
of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions
of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction
from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide
foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,
allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results
show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces
computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks
and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that
human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic
vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis
of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,
interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video
models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Context: Mpox is a zoonotic disease caused by the Mpox virus, which shares
similarities with other skin conditions, making accurate early diagnosis
challenging. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a
strong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs
and XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study
aims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and
multi-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using
Grad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used
for training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to
fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid
overfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing
critical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on
the binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on
the multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully
highlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed
overfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and
validation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of
pre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.
Future work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data,
and explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic
reliability and model transparency</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it easier to create realistic fake
profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for
text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of
existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in
detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the
existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate:
42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure,
restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False
Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on
combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness,
followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using
textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based
GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

            <p class="paper-summary">Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art low-parameter deep
neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.

            <p class="paper-summary">Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly

            <p class="paper-summary">Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next
generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art
performance in both cases.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made
publicly available.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

            <p class="paper-summary">Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a core task in computer vision. Multimodal
methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated
exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of

features in CLIP for IQA, this study proposes a visual-language model knowledge
distillation method aimed at guiding the training of models with architectural
advantages using CLIP's IQA knowledge. First, quality-graded prompt templates
were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned
to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple
IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly
reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The proliferation of MultiLingual Visual Question Answering (MLVQA)
benchmarks augments the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
multi-modal LLMs, thereby enabling them to adeptly capture the intricate
linguistic subtleties and visual complexities inherent across diverse
languages. Despite its potential, the current MLVQA model struggles to fully
utilize its capabilities when dealing with the extensive variety of handwritten
documents. This article delineates HW-MLVQA, an avant-garde VQA benchmark
meticulously crafted to mitigate the dearth of authentic Multilingual
Handwritten document comprehension. HW-MLVQA encompasses an extensive
collection of 1,600 handwritten Pages complemented by 2,400 question-answers.
Furthermore, it provides a robust benchmark evaluation framework spanning three
distinct modalities: text, image, and an integrated image & text modality. To
simulate authentic real-world contexts devoid of ground truth textual
transcriptions, we facilitates a rigorous assessment of proprietary and
open-source OCR models. The benchmark aspires to facilitate pivotal
advancements in multilingual handwritten document interpretation, fostering
innovation and scholarly inquiry within this specialized domain.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is a cornerstone of music digitization
initiatives in cultural heritage, yet it remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,
uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in
data-scarcity scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and
highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The
application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the
discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry
constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra
continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian
primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing
memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a
discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by
encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us
to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity
transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the
computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the
discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete
representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\eg Eikonal
loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and
enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based
consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher
relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding
complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method
outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We
empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and
instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.
Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic
manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied. More details are

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical image segmentation is crucial for many healthcare tasks, including
disease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of
skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring
patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation
model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on
low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the
generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of
standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking
datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving
state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes
the proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work
advances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical
image analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare
professionals. The code is made publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Terahertz (THz) imaging enables non-invasive analysis for applications such
as security screening and material classification, but effective image
classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution,
and visual ambiguity. We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that
requires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt
two open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and
one-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and
interpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of
ICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for
resource-constrained scientific domains. Code:

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.</p>

metastatic sites, and forgo molecular information such as PD-L1
immunohistochemistry (IHC). To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data

NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of
interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i)
multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides,
with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection,

            <p class="paper-summary">Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging
task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address
this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

            <p class="paper-summary">Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but existing
models often assume fixed, high-resolution inputs and degrade significantly
when faced with lower-resolution data in real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we propose RARE-UNet, a resolution-aware multi-scale segmentation
architecture that dynamically adapts its inference path to the spatial
resolution of the input. Central to our design are multi-scale blocks
integrated at multiple encoder depths, a resolution-aware routing mechanism,
and consistency-driven training that aligns multi-resolution features with
full-resolution representations. We evaluate RARE-UNet on two benchmark brain
imaging tasks for hippocampus and tumor segmentation. Compared to standard
UNet, its multi-resolution augmented variant, and nnUNet, our model achieves
the highest average Dice scores of 0.84 and 0.65 across resolution, while
maintaining consistent performance and significantly reduced inference time at
lower resolutions. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of
our architecture in achieving resolution-robust segmentation. The codes are

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have made promising
progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves
superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets. Code is available

            <p class="paper-summary">Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based
on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from
the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning
and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their
advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal
data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in
complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain
vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex
chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic
data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning
data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of
reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training
strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and
Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims
to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable
subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for
improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the
typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft
reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity
in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks
and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental
results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain
methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g.,
GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and
navigation. We propose a novel LiDAR-Visual odometry framework that integrates
LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our
method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images
through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction
network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware
representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine
flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our
hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively,
ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities.
Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our
approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to

            <p class="paper-summary">We report our recent progress towards building generalist robot policies, the
development of GR-3. GR-3 is a large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) model.
It showcases exceptional capabilities in generalizing to novel objects,

be efficiently fine-tuned with minimal human trajectory data, enabling rapid

long-horizon and dexterous tasks, including those requiring bi-manual

These capabilities are achieved through a multi-faceted training recipe that
includes co-training with web-scale vision-language data, efficient fine-tuning
from human trajectory data collected via VR devices, and effective imitation
learning with robot trajectory data. In addition, we introduce ByteMini, a
versatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with exceptional flexibility and
reliability, capable of accomplishing a wide range of tasks when integrated

            <p class="paper-summary">Enabling efficient text-video retrieval on edge-end devices is critical for
real-world applications. Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in
balancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods
ensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while
salient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic
frame selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose
ProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with
significantly improved efficiency. We design a prompt-aware frame sampling
strategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual
prompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of
existing salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic
selection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy
that combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered
fine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving
accuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency
reduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e.,

            <p class="paper-summary">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency
domain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in
medical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for
robust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose
DeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel
framework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse
spatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a
Decoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from
different MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction,
and a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet,
enabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion
characteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On
a six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1
accuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external
validation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On
a spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification
task, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal
and external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that
both DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over
10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the
potential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion
classification in multi-sequence medical imaging.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Surface defect detection of steel, especially the recognition of multi-scale
defects, has always been a major challenge in industrial manufacturing. Steel
surfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the
accuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex
environments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of
insufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small
target defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection
framework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the
C3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve
detection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to
reduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing
the spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to
enhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant
computations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,
the CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps
in a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures
detailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher accuracy and robustness in
steel surface defect detection tasks compared to other methods, effectively
addressing defect detection problems.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and
real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits
object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware
framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual
objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs,
enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically
grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID
encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We
show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks,
but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene
editing. Project page: https://ruijiezhu94.github.io/ObjectGS_page</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels
presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic
disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but
they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow
recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this
work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for
hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We
develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates
local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a
disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which
infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances
are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement
learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during
lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time
disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract
transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe
wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time
flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in
aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on
the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,
circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and
fluid dynamics.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER
demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

            <p class="paper-summary">Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized
fine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in
preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this
work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented
as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for
achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a
partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the
shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within
the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending
algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a
progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate
blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited
version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing
the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques
across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original
shape and also adherence to the textual description.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most
informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in
resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which
focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the
learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of
Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that
characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,
coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a
predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the
estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across
different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and
self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes
effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting
full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals
crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the
scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective
strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays
the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of
AL in both research and real-world applications. The code is available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed
problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized
hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven
learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and
deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The state of the art in human-centric computer vision achieves high accuracy
and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction
tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground
segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and
inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our
human-centric synthetic dataset and trained models are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical image segmentation suffers from data scarcity, particularly in polyp
detection where annotation requires specialized expertise. We present SynDiff,
a framework combining text-guided synthetic data generation with efficient
diffusion-based segmentation. Our approach employs latent diffusion models to
generate clinically realistic synthetic polyps through text-conditioned
inpainting, augmenting limited training data with semantically diverse samples.
Unlike traditional diffusion methods requiring iterative denoising, we
introduce direct latent estimation enabling single-step inference with T x
computational speedup. On CVC-ClinicDB, SynDiff achieves 96.0% Dice and 92.9%
IoU while maintaining real-time capability suitable for clinical deployment.
The framework demonstrates that controlled synthetic augmentation improves
segmentation robustness without distribution shift. SynDiff bridges the gap
between data-hungry deep learning models and clinical constraints, offering an
efficient solution for deployment in resourcelimited medical settings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Pavement defect detection faces critical challenges including limited
annotated data, domain shift between training and deployment environments, and
high variability in defect appearances across different road conditions. We
propose RoadFusion, a framework that addresses these limitations through
synthetic anomaly generation with dual-path feature adaptation. A latent
diffusion model synthesizes diverse, realistic defects using text prompts and
spatial masks, enabling effective training under data scarcity. Two separate
feature adaptors specialize representations for normal and anomalous inputs,
improving robustness to domain shift and defect variability. A lightweight
discriminator learns to distinguish fine-grained defect patterns at the patch
level. Evaluated on six benchmark datasets, RoadFusion achieves consistently
strong performance across both classification and localization tasks, setting
new state-of-the-art in multiple metrics relevant to real-world road
inspection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">High-resolution volumetric computed tomography (CT) is essential for accurate
diagnosis and treatment planning in thoracic diseases; however, it is limited
by radiation dose and hardware costs. We present the Transformer Volumetric
Super-Resolution Network (\textbf{TVSRN-V2}), a transformer-based
super-resolution (SR) framework designed for practical deployment in clinical
lung CT analysis. Built from scalable components, including Through-Plane
Attention Blocks (TAB) and Swin Transformer V2 -- our model effectively
reconstructs fine anatomical details in low-dose CT volumes and integrates
seamlessly with downstream analysis pipelines. We evaluate its effectiveness on
three critical lung cancer tasks -- lobe segmentation, radiomics, and prognosis
-- across multiple clinical cohorts. To enhance robustness across variable
acquisition protocols, we introduce pseudo-low-resolution augmentation,
simulating scanner diversity without requiring private data. TVSRN-V2
demonstrates a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (+4\% Dice),
higher radiomic feature reproducibility, and enhanced predictive performance
(+0.06 C-index and AUC). These results indicate that SR-driven recovery of
structural detail significantly enhances clinical decision support, positioning
TVSRN-V2 as a well-engineered, clinically viable system for dose-efficient
imaging and quantitative analysis in real-world CT workflows.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine
disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Depth estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse
applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding

            <p class="paper-summary">Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for
surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the
complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce
EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with
mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic
environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference
Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with
dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while
maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification
(HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores
using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization
despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive
softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that
modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement,
or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force
attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical
scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while
distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow
conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four
different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including
occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.
Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations
demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in
both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness
across challenging surgical conditions. The code, dataset, and video results
are available at https://szupc.github.io/EndoControlMag/.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the
detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection
methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks
on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at
reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the

updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the
extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published

where understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this
work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast
imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model
pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast
concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE
latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings
of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Advancements in 3D vision have increased the impact of blood vessel modeling
on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful
application of a part-based generative approach for 3D vessel modeling, setting
a new benchmark for vascular data generation. The code is available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes
will be released soon in public.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we introduce MeshMamba, a neural network model for learning 3D
articulated mesh models by employing the recently proposed Mamba State Space
Models (Mamba-SSMs). MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large
number of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh
models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,
while achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) provide personalized in-silico cardiac
representations and hold great potential for precision medicine in cardiology.
However, whole-heart CDT models that simulate the full organ-scale
electromechanics of all four heart chambers remain limited. In this work, we
propose a weakly supervised learning model to reconstruct 4D (3D+t) heart mesh
directly from multi-view 2D cardiac cine MRIs. This is achieved by learning a
self-supervised mapping between cine MRIs and 4D cardiac meshes, enabling the
generation of personalized heart models that closely correspond to input cine
MRIs. The resulting 4D heart meshes can facilitate the automatic extraction of
key cardiac variables, including ejection fraction and dynamic chamber volume
changes with high temporal resolution. It demonstrates the feasibility of
inferring personalized 4D heart models from cardiac MRIs, paving the way for an
efficient CDT platform for precision medicine. The code will be publicly
released once the manuscript is accepted.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate representation of myocardial infarct geometry is crucial for
patient-specific cardiac modeling in MI patients. While Late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) MRI is the clinical gold standard for infarct detection, it
requires contrast agents, introducing side effects and patient discomfort.
Moreover, infarct reconstruction from LGE often relies on sparsely sampled 2D
slices, limiting spatial resolution and accuracy. In this work, we propose a
novel framework for automatically reconstructing high-fidelity 3D myocardial
infarct geometry from 2D clinically standard cine MRI, eliminating the need for
contrast agents. Specifically, we first reconstruct the 4D biventricular mesh
from multi-view cine MRIs via an automatic deep shape fitting model, biv-me.
Then, we design a infarction reconstruction model, CMotion2Infarct-Net, to
explicitly utilize the motion patterns within this dynamic geometry to localize
infarct regions. Evaluated on 205 cine MRI scans from 126 MI patients, our
method shows reasonable agreement with manual delineation. This study
demonstrates the feasibility of contrast-free, cardiac motion-driven 3D infarct
reconstruction, paving the way for efficient digital twin of MI.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate segmentation of pheochromocytoma (PCC) in abdominal CT scans is
essential for tumor burden estimation, prognosis, and treatment planning. It
may also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing.
This study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify
configurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed
the nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D
segmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class
schemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived
from adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,
kidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad
body-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested
on 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.
Performance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized
Surface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the
Tumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation
accuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)
annotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%
improvement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.
The TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)
and strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold
cross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1
to 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability. These findings
highlight the value of incorporating relevant anatomical context into deep
learning models to achieve precise PCC segmentation, offering a valuable tool
to support clinical assessment and longitudinal disease monitoring in PCC
patients.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Anemia is a widespread global health issue, particularly among young children
in low-resource settings. Traditional methods for anemia detection often
require expensive equipment and expert knowledge, creating barriers to early
and accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we explore the use of deep
learning models for detecting anemia through conjunctival pallor, focusing on
the CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59
months. The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age and other
demographic data, enabling the development of machine learning models for
accurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone,
known for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and
fine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques and a
cross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accuracy of
0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an F1 score of 0.9773 demonstrating strong
performance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge
devices, we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of
different bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model performance.
Preliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high
accuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370), and F1 Score (0.9377), more aggressive
quantization (INT8 and INT4) leads to significant performance degradation.
Overall, our study supports further exploration of quantization schemes and
hardware optimizations to assess trade-offs between model size, inference time,
and diagnostic accuracy in mobile healthcare applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results

            <p class="paper-summary">The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces
persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support,
and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions
neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health
workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled
Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure
patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on
small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage
with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we
integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor
analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with
KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL
and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To
optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8,
reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5
at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data
privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made

(SLAM) loop closure problem is the recognition of previously visited places. In
this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop
closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the
embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the
classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic
visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is
designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an
index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction
quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep
learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is

            <p class="paper-summary">Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.</p>

            <h2 class="paper-title">Visual Place Recognition for Large-Scale UAV Applications</h2>
            
            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.</p>

            <h2 class="paper-title">Aesthetics is Cheap, Show me the Text: An Empirical Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Generative Models for OCR</h2>
            
            <p class="paper-summary">Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.</p>

            <h2 class="paper-title">PET Image Reconstruction Using Deep Diffusion Image Prior</h2>
            
            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and
reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high
computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET
image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep
diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between
diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling
the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a
score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve
computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was
adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The
proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets.
For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested
on amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.
For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one
[$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from
another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction
method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types,
providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET
imaging.</p>
