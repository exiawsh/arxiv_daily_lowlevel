            <p class="paper-summary">Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for
modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a
challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for
simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network
compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce
desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,
class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate
that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and
regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.
In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across
diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present
strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates
in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing
hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic,
and dynamic world, which allows exploration and control using peripheral
devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of
\method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows
exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity
and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework,
which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,
video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,
we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion
Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an
autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)
and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)
are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise
control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic
optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the
high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves
remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and
model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will
update monthly to achieve its original goal. Project page:

            <p class="paper-summary">Facial filters are now commonplace for social media users around the world.
Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact
automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small
numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more
effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social
media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study
of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework
includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection
process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and
a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We
demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American
applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu
to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering
effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve
face recognition performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally

            <p class="paper-summary">State-of-the-art visual under-canopy navigation methods are designed with
deep learning-based perception models to distinguish traversable space from
crop rows. While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they
require large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world
field deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant
human resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this
challenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during
model training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to
diversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we
hypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to
suboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with
frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we
propose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)
which masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed
around crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level
contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our
extensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that
masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and
significantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual
navigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward
crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and
generalizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction
in prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the
number of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks
to maximize overall performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of
desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to
unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to
adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been
studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains
elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how
different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral
compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of
compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the
representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective
perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,
revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$
robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the
vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -
whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.
Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm
our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities
persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the
emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a
fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and
suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal
data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in
understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks
(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited
vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being
non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models
(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.
This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception
systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case
situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to
either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who
are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in
reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving
systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous
decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the
performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic
situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for
capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe
that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding
capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult
to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements
in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such
as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep
neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various
robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric
losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict
constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly
optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting
ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding
advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging
theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust
loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.
However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced
optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and
applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric
losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario
and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We
rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE
satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric
passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss
framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate classification of articulatory-phonological features plays a vital
role in understanding human speech production and developing robust speech
technologies, particularly in clinical contexts where targeted phonemic
analysis and therapy can improve disease diagnosis accuracy and personalized
rehabilitation. In this work, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework
that combines real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) and speech signals
to classify three key articulatory dimensions: manner of articulation, place of
articulation, and voicing. We perform classification on 15 phonological classes
derived from the aforementioned articulatory dimensions and evaluate the system
with four audio/vision configurations: unimodal rtMRI, unimodal audio signals,
multimodal middle fusion, and contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion.
Experimental results on the USC-TIMIT dataset show that our contrastive
learning-based approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average
F1-score of 0.81, representing an absolute increase of 0.23 over the unimodal
baseline. The results confirm the effectiveness of contrastive representation

            <p class="paper-summary">Myocardial motion tracking is important for assessing cardiac function and
diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, for which cine cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) has been established as the gold standard imaging modality. Many existing
methods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame
and a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these
methods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield
inconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a
novel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly
incorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and
temporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba
block equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates
the estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion
decoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target
frame, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking
advantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method
learns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without
increasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two
public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and
state-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods. The code is

            <p class="paper-summary">With the rise of robotics, LiDAR-based 3D object detection has garnered
significant attention in both academia and industry. However, existing datasets
and methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other
autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET,
the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations
collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby
facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well
as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel
cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the
well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves
perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric
and feature levels. Additionally, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the
resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios,
providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging
cross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation
methods. We hope this work paves the way for generalizable and unified 3D
perception systems across diverse and complex environments. Our Pi3DET dataset,
cross-platform benchmark suite, and annotation toolkit have been made publicly

            <p class="paper-summary">Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur,
making them ideal for understanding dynamic environments. Yet, connecting these
asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. We introduce
Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object
grounding in event-based perception. Built from real-world driving data, we
provide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four
grounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to
other objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully
exploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding
framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a
Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different
modalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art
baselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope
our dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal,
temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and
autonomy.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
mortality among women, despite recent advances in Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) systems. Accurate and efficient interpretation of multi-view mammograms
is essential for early detection, driving a surge of interest in Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-powered CAD models. While state-of-the-art multi-view
mammogram classification models are largely based on Transformer architectures,
their computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of image
patches, highlighting the need for more efficient alternatives. To address this
challenge, we propose Mammo-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Selective
State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven
feature refinement into a unified architecture. Mammo-Mamba extends the
MambaVision backbone by introducing the Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE)
mechanism through its customized SecMamba block. The SecMamba is a modified
MambaVision block that enhances representation learning in high-resolution
mammographic images by enabling content-adaptive feature refinement. These
blocks are integrated into the deeper stages of MambaVision, allowing the model
to progressively adjust feature emphasis through dynamic expert gating,
effectively mitigating the limitations of traditional Transformer models.
Evaluated on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, Mammo-Mamba achieves superior
classification performance across all key metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise
occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods
adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible
region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being
affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal
performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage
framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked
Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent
Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask
updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the
computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to
reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to
the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and
outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and
SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under
various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in
enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is
publicly available.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is
fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This
"seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust,
multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the
forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning
framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three
complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to
perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a
prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal
Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly
grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework
achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive
experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,
significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior
methodological design can outperform sheer model scale.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time
Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving
attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified
framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,
propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only
model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to
semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the
attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable
states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix
multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define
TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global
token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in
unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of
how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is
to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.
While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,
they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.
Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for
benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,
we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD
robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative
nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual
nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion
models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that
outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with
generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study
to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance
shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model
rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be
captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that
evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the
identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding
of model robustness. Project page including code and data:

            <p class="paper-summary">Person identification in unconstrained viewing environments presents
significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging
conditions, and clothing. We introduce $\textbf{E}$va $\textbf{C}$lothes-Change
from $\textbf{H}$idden $\textbf{O}$bjects - $\textbf{B}$ody
$\textbf{ID}$entification (ECHO-BID), a class of long-term re-id models built
on object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones. We compare ECHO-BID to 9 other
models that vary systematically in backbone architecture, model size, scale of
object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocol. Models were
evaluated on benchmark datasets across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded
settings. ECHO-BID, with transfer learning on the most challenging
clothes-change data, achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-id --
substantially outperforming other methods. ECHO-BID also surpassed other
methods by a wide margin in occluded viewing scenarios. A combination of
increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining underlie
ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-id. Notably, a smaller, but more
challenging transfer learning dataset, generalized better across datasets than
a larger, less challenging one. However, the larger dataset with an additional
fine-tuning step proved best on the most difficult data. Selecting the correct

            <p class="paper-summary">Understanding lane toplogy relationships accurately is critical for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing two-stage methods suffer from
inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads.
To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that
simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology
relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology
understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing
intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This
approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the
element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among
traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally
expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that
knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD)
maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance
even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy
and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element
identification, and topology reasoning. Our code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We present InvRGB+L, a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large,
relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional
inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR
mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material
estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity
values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer
complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.
Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome
challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key
innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR
material consistency losses. The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR
renderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports relighting, night
simulations, and dynamic object insertions, achieving results that surpass
current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering
and LiDAR simulation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">As surgery embraces digital transformation--integrating sophisticated
imaging, advanced algorithms, and robotics to support and automate complex
sub-tasks--human judgment of system correctness remains a vital safeguard for
patient safety. This shift introduces new "operator-type" roles tasked with
verifying complex algorithmic outputs, particularly at critical junctures of
the procedure, such as the intermediary check before drilling or implant
placement. A prime example is 2D/3D registration, a key enabler of image-based
surgical navigation that aligns intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D
data. Although registration algorithms have advanced significantly, they
occasionally yield inaccurate results. Because even small misalignments can
lead to revision surgery or irreversible surgical errors, there is a critical
need for robust quality assurance. Current visualization-based strategies alone
have been found insufficient to enable humans to reliably detect 2D/3D
registration misalignments. In response, we propose the first artificial
intelligence (AI) framework trained specifically for 2D/3D registration quality
verification, augmented by explainability features that clarify the model's
decision-making. Our explainable AI (XAI) approach aims to enhance informed
decision-making for human operators by providing a second opinion together with
a rationale behind it. Through algorithm-centric and human-centered
evaluations, we systematically compare four conditions: AI-only, human-only,
human-AI, and human-XAI. Our findings reveal that while explainability features
modestly improve user trust and willingness to override AI errors, they do not
exceed the standalone AI in aggregate performance. Nevertheless, future work
extending both the algorithmic design and the human-XAI collaboration elements
holds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching
the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being
significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making
it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and
the code will be at https://maxiuw.github.io/prix.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled
the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to
traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping
completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details
and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread
application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We
introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene
reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and
large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a
residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and
an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained
details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for
detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting
with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus
paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the
residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via
bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize
poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel
technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better
optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local
moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a
divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our
residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit
or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and
tracking on large-scale scenes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object
recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction by providing more
adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation
by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,
state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at
inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their
robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose
D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust
vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text
and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which
naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic
cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and
reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich
cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate
training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss
that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.
Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves
superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few
samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding
unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has
renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial
attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our
work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of
abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes
critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In
this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD
(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages
adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can
efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we
further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs
perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy
offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite
their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,
highlighting their effectiveness.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in
the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in
specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of
annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which
hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,
an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning
capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the
intelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and
leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease
classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis
within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically
aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable
reasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,
achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,
surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in
zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling
law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$),
demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance
data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with
diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned
MLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific
MLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising
effectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features
between 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing
multi-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training
task to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents
the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant
tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in
complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a
Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud
understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)
Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing
the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level
reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions
directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed
point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning
(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus
assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image
modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates
without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large
datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various
downstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and
generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic
point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal
correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing
this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE)
network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the
visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions
include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference
attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise
inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that
dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames,
a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently
captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a
joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to
alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error
optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved
improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with
Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5%

            <p class="paper-summary">To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal
reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing
vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow
their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible
reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading
manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm,
Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal
training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual
reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated
650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves
30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce
SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and
high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA
by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA
surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling
by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both
simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's
potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with
efficient policy learning.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a
separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during
reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,
resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a
static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy
Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward
modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our
method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable
reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format
optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This
enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic
while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified
model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative
reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24
to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,
URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,
achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward
model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model
and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO
presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly
aligned language models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial
computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for
real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant
communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,
limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression
framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation
quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong
temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,
saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.
To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that
encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via
Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise
activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical
justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling
substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate
lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion
establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower
latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On
4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also
uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on
slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.
CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,
and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable
implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Automated X-ray inspection is crucial for efficient and unobtrusive security
screening in various public settings. However, challenges such as object
occlusion, variations in the physical properties of items, diversity in X-ray
scanning devices, and limited training data hinder accurate and reliable
detection of illicit items. Despite the large body of research in the field,
reported experimental evaluations are often incomplete, with frequently
conflicting outcomes. To shed light on the research landscape and facilitate
further research, a systematic, detailed, and thorough comparative evaluation
of recent Deep Learning (DL)-based methods for X-ray object detection is
conducted. For this, a comprehensive evaluation framework is developed,
composed of: a) Six recent, large-scale, and widely used public datasets for
X-ray illicit item detection (OPIXray, CLCXray, SIXray, EDS, HiXray, and
PIDray), b) Ten different state-of-the-art object detection schemes covering
all main categories in the literature, including generic Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), custom CNN, generic transformer, and hybrid CNN-transformer
architectures, and c) Various detection (mAP50 and mAP50:95) and
time/computational-complexity (inference time (ms), parameter size (M), and
computational load (GFLOPS)) metrics. A thorough analysis of the results leads
to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a)
Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection
performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and
computational complexity analysis. To support reproducibility of the reported

            <p class="paper-summary">Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet
their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning
rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that
it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this
paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is
meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training
with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers
trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate
normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively
modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,
activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of
gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the
normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on
two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its
counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with
vanilla mSGDW.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in
images, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of
downstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue
to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural
damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging
flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference
images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this
paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that
decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,
effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists
mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local
detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive
the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing
global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from
content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning
strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference
image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves
fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
performance. The code is available at

identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting

            <p class="paper-summary">Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to
directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,
the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely
constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies
like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful
strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view
sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we
propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation
framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on
single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core
challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic
views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low
computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical
objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of
innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we
introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that
learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.
Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse
Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views
and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the
views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,
we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted
expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of
VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify humans and objects
within images and interpret their interactions. Existing HOI methods rely
heavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from
visual cues. These annotations are labor-intensive to create, prone to
inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. We
argue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped
potential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior
work has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there
remain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection
framework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively
utilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal
registry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry
incorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction
signatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective
generalization to rare interactions. Additionally, we propose a unique
multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights the contributions of the
visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our DYSCO
surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with
training-based approaches, particularly excelling in rare interactions. Code is

            <p class="paper-summary">Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced
or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and
challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and
disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental
conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for
geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while
classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive
training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.
However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to
hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone
solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework
that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place
recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a
prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then
employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the
most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity
to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple
geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level
(up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in
combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization
systems.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary
object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but
smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain,
revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate
with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers,
fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed
partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing
specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding
DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an
efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity
decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base
model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space.
To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further
propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with
a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant
experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that,
pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms
Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In computed tomography (CT), achieving high image quality while minimizing
radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents
CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and
Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT
integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube
current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships
that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is
employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations
from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters.
These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes
in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is
trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong
predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability,
CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and
technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans.

            <p class="paper-summary">The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large
and unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)
introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved
diagnostic processes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving
state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a
strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these
methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without
ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world
light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry
changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first
non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a
dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion
with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a
physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints
for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat
scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to
obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera
trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then
refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.
From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle
with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar
environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses
in world coordinates.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal
temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic
modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and
enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have
either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for
practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails
to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely
EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored
Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the
learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation
pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling
capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's
ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on
semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves
the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation. Code released at

            <p class="paper-summary">Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations
of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen
compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling
attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.
However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual
dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally
pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" applies to "zebra" or "shirts" but
not "sky" or "water"), while the same attribute can manifest differently
depending on context (e.g., "young" in "young tree" vs. "young dog"). Thus,
capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet
long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional
Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.
We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the
likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To
enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to
highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features
then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring
better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and
conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional
dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments
on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code
is available at here.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural
networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would
incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks
like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a
strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this
setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are
selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial
diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate
spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g.,
data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based
active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively
improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based
active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully

            <p class="paper-summary">The development of X-Ray microscopy (XRM) technology has enabled
non-destructive inspection of semiconductor structures for defect
identification. Deep learning is widely used as the state-of-the-art approach

large amount of annotated data to train. This can be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic

solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We identify two unique challenges
when applying AL on semiconductor XRM scans: large domain shift and severe
class-imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose to perform contrastive
pretraining on the unlabelled data to obtain the initialization weights for
each AL cycle, and a rareness-aware acquisition function that favors the
selection of samples containing rare classes. We evaluate our method on a

            <p class="paper-summary">In the field of food image processing, efficient semantic segmentation
techniques are crucial for industrial applications. However, existing
large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in
meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts
and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter
module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that
integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer
architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating
only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its
hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in
depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in
features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing
strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate
that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and
UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized
FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).
Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization
capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for
assembling lightweight food image.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across
various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging
conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations
encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this
paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder
with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and
double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line
license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate
dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and
blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the
system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network
(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit
variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This
network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.
The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on
the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When
evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to
99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average
recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167
frames per second, indicating strong practical applicability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main
limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such
as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into
others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to
infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most
existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part
segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.
In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a
key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core
components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we
propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially
reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based
on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into
texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module
(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image
generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human
reconstruction. The project page is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,
and real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of
achieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in
intelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast
creation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to
digital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,
interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less
attention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high
rendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and
real-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient
and expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered
segmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables
dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present
CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital
humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape
basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes
suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based
on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the
rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that
closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work
provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon
characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual
character animation. The project homepage is

            <p class="paper-summary">Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in
challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search
across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further
improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors
for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two
progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention
mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,
one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the
one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this
pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce
the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains
of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup
of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient
method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority
in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain
generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive
and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is

            <p class="paper-summary">In the context of Industry 4.0, effective monitoring of multiple targets and
states during assembly processes is crucial, particularly when constrained to
using only visual sensors. Traditional methods often rely on either multiple
sensor types or complex hardware setups to achieve high accuracy in monitoring,
which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial
environments. This study presents a novel approach that leverages multiple
machine learning models to achieve precise monitoring under the limitation of
using a minimal number of visual sensors. By integrating state information from
identical timestamps, our method detects and confirms the current stage of the
assembly process with an average accuracy exceeding 92%. Furthermore, our
approach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection
and visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to
operators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly
monitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making
it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate
pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic
analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks
that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However,
current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained
reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive
chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to
simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at region-of-interest
(ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as
ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI)
classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present
SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both
ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning
capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and
task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for
chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM.
Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through
a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks.
We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI
samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks
validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work
represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced
AI systems for precision pathology.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Mamba has recently gained widespread attention as a backbone model for point
cloud modeling, leveraging a state-space architecture that enables efficient
global sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, its lack of local
inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures
in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point
cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,
a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a
conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,
the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert
space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens
for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent
Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)
module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by
leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This
enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To
further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion
mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences
without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple
benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its
effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.</p>

the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated
prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image
segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,
providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)
to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask
results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain
generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully
automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted
Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty
Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module
integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty
distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding
box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with
SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image
embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the
target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive
experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate
the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above
challenges.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Early diagnosis and accurate identification of lesion location and
progression in prostate cancer (PCa) are critical for assisting clinicians in
formulating effective treatment strategies. However, due to the high semantic
homogeneity between lesion and non-lesion areas, existing medical image
segmentation methods often struggle to accurately comprehend lesion semantics,
resulting in the problem of semantic confusion. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Pixel Anchor Module, which guides the model to discover a
sparse set of feature anchors that serve to capture and interpret global
contextual information. This mechanism enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capacity and improves segmentation accuracy within lesion
regions. Moreover, we design a self-attention-based Top_k selection strategy to
further refine the identification of these feature anchors, and incorporate a
focal loss function to mitigate class imbalance, thereby facilitating more
precise semantic interpretation across diverse regions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the PI-CAI dataset, demonstrating 69.73% IoU
and 74.32% Dice scores, and significantly improving prostate cancer lesion
detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks,
but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader
application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic
polarization images. The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a
parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets
covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale
photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,
capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both
photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset
collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained
diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an
effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization
properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization
images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been a widely studied topic, with
extensive research focusing on how VLMs respond to answerable questions based
on real-world images. However, there has been limited exploration of how these
models handle unanswerable questions, particularly in cases where they should
abstain from providing a response. This research investigates VQA performance
on unrealistically generated images or asking unanswerable questions, assessing
whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge or attempt to
generate incorrect answers. We introduced a dataset, VisionTrap, comprising
three categories of unanswerable questions across diverse image types: (1)
hybrid entities that fuse objects and animals, (2) objects depicted in
unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent
figures. The questions posed are logically structured yet inherently
unanswerable, testing whether models can correctly recognize their limitations.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating such questions into VQA
benchmarks to evaluate whether models tend to answer, even when they should
abstain.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Current exposure correction methods have three challenges, labor-intensive
paired data annotation, limited generalizability, and performance degradation
in low-level computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce an innovative
Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates the need for
manual annotations, offers improved generalizability, and enhances performance
in low-level downstream tasks. Our model is trained using freely available
paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline. This
approach does not need expensive manual annotations, thereby minimizing
individual style biases from the annotation and consequently improving its
generalizability. Furthermore, we present a large-scale Radiometry Correction
Dataset, specifically designed to emphasize exposure variations, to facilitate
unsupervised learning. In addition, we develop a transformation function that
preserves image details and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods
[12], while utilizing only 0.01% of their parameters. Our work further
investigates the broader impact of exposure correction on downstream tasks,
including edge detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the
adverse effects of poor exposure on low-level features. The source code and

            <p class="paper-summary">Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are employed in many practical image
and video processing pipelines to reduce storage, minimize transmission costs,
and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of millions of viewers. These
models are sensitive to a diverse range of image distortions and can accurately
predict image quality as judged by human viewers. Recent advancements in
generative models have resulted in a significant influx of "GenAI" content on
the internet. Existing methods for detecting GenAI content have progressed
significantly with improved generalization performance on images from unseen
generative models. Here, we leverage the capabilities of existing IQA models,
which effectively capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass
statistical space, to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We
investigate the generalization ability of these perceptual classifiers to the
task of GenAI image detection and evaluate their robustness against various
image degradations. Our results show that a two-layer network trained on the
feature space of IQA models demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
detecting fake images across generative models, while maintaining significant
robustness against image degradations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via
vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised
pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to
boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models
exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to
learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we
investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,
aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data
for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a
synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training
framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge
in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model
lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.
To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the
CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic
specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for
semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation
loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature
space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With
this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both
paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning
increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive
computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by
compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while
preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance
under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations
for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this
work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset
distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes
decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of
quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss
as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable
fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise
storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\times$
greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across
diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our
approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent studies have explored pretrained (foundation) models for vision-based
robotic navigation, aiming to achieve generalizable navigation and positive
transfer across diverse environments while enhancing zero-shot performance in
unseen settings. In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal
Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies
for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas.
Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve
the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an
early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images
via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2)
introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation
representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance.
Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently
labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We
demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse
gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average
improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in
fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two
complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results
advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models.
Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring
significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment with minimal labeled supervision.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing
workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,
particularly in small and medium-sized operations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is
labor-intensive for dental technicians. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel voxel-based framework for automated dental crown design (VBCD). The VBCD
framework generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral
scans, followed by a fine-grained refiner incorporating distance-aware
supervision to improve accuracy and quality. During the training stage, we
employ the Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) to enhance the
alignment of the generated crown with the margin line. Additionally, a
positional prompt based on the FDI tooth numbering system is introduced to
further improve the accuracy of the generated dental crowns. Evaluation on a
large-scale dataset of intraoral scans demonstrated that our approach
outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for personalized
dental crown design.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts
due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous
automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the
ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world
workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two
roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled
perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the
contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab
outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by
embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,
professional slides.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">When synthesizing identities as face recognition training data, it is
generally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class
attribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This
belief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when
increasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of
maintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate
high-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that
creates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy
control of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets
with proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity
consistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different
from others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP
algorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based
pose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more
efficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,
a synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the
size to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets
yield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on
five real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the
CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11
synthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\emph{i.e., 50\%}) in twin
verification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased
than those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future
investigation. Code is available at https://github.com/HaiyuWu/Vec2Face_plus</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes

            <p class="paper-summary">The quality assessment of AI-generated content (AIGC) faces multi-dimensional
challenges, that span from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic
understanding. Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,
limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To
address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is
proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical
fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are
developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)
is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary
local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The
Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image
correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion
process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then
aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate
outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the
proposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high
speed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to
take into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the
requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.
Therefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved
with YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,
network lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the
detection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck
network and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning
rate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the
backbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic
features to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with
small number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of
multi-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect
detection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to
share the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping
convolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which
significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy
of detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve
the detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned
by an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the
model. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of
accuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5
reaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared
to YOLOv8n.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent
modality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive
nature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by
blending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system
integrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face
biometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.
Simulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle
uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris
boundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,
that encompasses landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy,
attention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis, and dynamic
weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence. DOOMGAN achieves
over 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent
thresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%
improved gaze consistency. We also release the first comprehensive ocular
morphing dataset to support further research in this domain.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for
specific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit
image enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor
generalization performance across different tasks, even across different
datasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a
universal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this
work, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of
exposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic
range (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from
public sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure
sequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via
multi-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from
a single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated
MES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image
Contrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it
demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing
image contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even
outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image

            <p class="paper-summary">The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but
suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process
and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies
that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling
time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We
hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts
correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not
consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this
paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a
novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a
single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative
models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates
sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled
approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the
numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using
both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with
minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to
unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA
adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet
without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim
0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, and
early diagnosis through automated retinal image analysis can significantly
reduce the risk of blindness. This paper presents a robust deep learning
framework for both binary and five-class DR classification, leveraging transfer
learning and extensive data augmentation to address the challenges of class
imbalance and limited training data. We evaluate a range of pretrained
convolutional neural network architectures, including variants of ResNet and
EfficientNet, on the APTOS 2019 dataset.
  For binary classification, our proposed model achieves a state-of-the-art
accuracy of 98.9%, with a precision of 98.6%, recall of 99.3%, F1-score of
98.9%, and an AUC of 99.4%. In the more challenging five-class severity
classification task, our model obtains a competitive accuracy of 84.6% and an
AUC of 94.1%, outperforming several existing approaches. Our findings also
demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 and ResNet34 offer optimal trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency across both tasks.
  These results underscore the effectiveness of combining class-balanced
augmentation with transfer learning for high-performance DR diagnosis. The
proposed framework provides a scalable and accurate solution for DR screening,
with potential for deployment in real-world clinical environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial
odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their
limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of
inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and
generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel
convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can
effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion
perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module
called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures
both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from
dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on
the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further
improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),
which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in
the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling
observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new
CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry
(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based
methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by
10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot
learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks.
However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in
federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients.
Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data,
leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized
adaptation of VLMs while preserving model privacy and reducing reliance on
centralized training. To further tackle data heterogeneity, we introduce
personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each
client's unique data distribution, significantly improving local adaptation
while maintaining global model aggregation. Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset
show that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% over standard
LoRA, demonstrating superior adaptation in non-iid settings. FedVLM provides a
scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning VLMs in federated settings,
advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation
platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding.
However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in
e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global
image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to
suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where
product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal
matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not
generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we
propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating
Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent
for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image
representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances
textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach
significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness,
and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the
largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by
15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework
outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in
both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining
object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust
multimodal recommendations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel
classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual
data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object
detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects
across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating
information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching
networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging
spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces
challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with
specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.
Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by
minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include
balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and
handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing
annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other
applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,
and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this
paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable
deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we introduce VideoNarrator, a novel training-free pipeline
designed to generate dense video captions that offer a structured snapshot of
video content. These captions offer detailed narrations with precise
timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite
advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video
comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations
and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator
addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where
off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption
generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly
enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing
hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not
only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as
video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially
extended for advertising and marketing applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of
captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected
in the video.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown
significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support
diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these
applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built
environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed
imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from
satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of
high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture
the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable
advancements in object detection and representation using visual data,
primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in
computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on
labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep
learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address
these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach
enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building
boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and
embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a
scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from
a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban
planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,
Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,
demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building
footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The
StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video
streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the
reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast
training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our
approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating
the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which
significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further
ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification
strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more
sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining
rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method
protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or
online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream
application such as animation, toonify, and relighting. Please refer to our
project page for more details: https://songluchuan.github.io/StreamME/.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

            <p class="paper-summary">Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern medical imaging technologies have greatly advanced neuroscience
research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across
different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit
substantial heterogeneity, known as "batch effects" or "site effects". These
non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals,
reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the
generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization
aims to eliminate or mitigate such site-related biases while preserving
meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and
consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts,
methodological advances, publicly available datasets, current challenges, and
future directions in the field of medical image harmonization, with a focus on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We systematically cover the full imaging
pipeline, and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition
and reconstruction strategies, retrospective image-level and feature-level
methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. Rather than providing an
exhaustive survey, we focus on representative methods, with particular emphasis
on deep learning-based approaches. Finally, we summarize the major challenges
that remain and outline promising avenues for future research.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms is essential for
effective breast cancer detection, yet it remains a complex challenge due to
subtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity. Many existing AI approaches
fall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting
their clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four
standard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS
scores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone,
combining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual
State Space Models (VSSMs) to capture global contextual dependencies. To
improve robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based
fusion module that dynamically weights information across views, effectively
handling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across
diagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models
against baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and
multi task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently
outperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task,
the shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830.
For the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of
0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.
These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework and
underscore both the potential and limitations of multitask learning for
improving diagnostic performance and enabling clinically meaningful mammography
analysis.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.</p>

            <h2 class="paper-title">Toward Long-Tailed Online Anomaly Detection through Class-Agnostic Concepts</h2>
            
            <p class="paper-summary">Anomaly detection (AD) identifies the defect regions of a given image. Recent
works have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with
long-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all
classes. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,
we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel
task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline
state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.
Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not
available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a
class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning
setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD
settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain.
In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods
that have access to class labels and the number of classes. In the most
challenging long-tailed online setting, we achieve +0.53% image-AUROC compared
to baselines. Our LTOAD benchmark is released here:

            <h2 class="paper-title">AURA: A Multi-Modal Medical Agent for Understanding, Reasoning & Annotation</h2>
            
            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm
shift from static prediction systems to agentic AI agents capable of reasoning,
interacting with tools, and adapting to complex tasks. While LLM-based agentic
systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical
imaging remains in its infancy. In this work, we introduce AURA, the first
visual linguistic explainability agent designed specifically for comprehensive
analysis, explanation, and evaluation of medical images. By enabling dynamic
interactions, contextual explanations, and hypothesis testing, AURA represents
a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically
aligned AI systems. We highlight the promise of agentic AI in transforming
medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support.
Leveraging Qwen-32B, an LLM-based architecture, AURA integrates a modular
toolbox comprising: (i) a segmentation suite with phase grounding, pathology
segmentation, and anatomy segmentation to localize clinically meaningful
regions; (ii) a counterfactual image-generation module that supports reasoning
through image-level explanations; and (iii) a set of evaluation tools including
pixel-wise difference-map analysis, classification, and advanced
state-of-the-art components to assess diagnostic relevance and visual
interpretability.</p>
