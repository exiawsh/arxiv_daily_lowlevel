            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret
multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in
dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an
end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit
reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to
complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system
framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via
reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate
embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards
based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are
compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model
for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on
embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct
enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction
behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking
reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs
are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability
because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL
offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling
trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to
mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,
this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for
vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy
behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable
LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns
outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.
Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning
trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive
experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the
effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in
average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on
multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and
OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.
Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy
RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy
training.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While existing image-guided composition methods may help insert a foreground
object onto a user-specified region of a background image, achieving natural
blending inside the region with the rest of the image unchanged, we observe
that these existing methods often struggle in synthesizing seamless
interaction-aware compositions when the task involves human-object
interactions. In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for
compositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while
ensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the
background person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two
key designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes
MLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,
holding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated
pose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track
action variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)
Detail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware
attention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background
consistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and
faithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first
dataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.
Experimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates
harmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and
outperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel
framework for accurate ST imputation that requires only a single and low-cost
sparsely sampled ST dataset alongside widely available natural images for
co-training. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a
sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while
preserving sampled gene data fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse tissue
types, including breast cancer, liver, and lymphoid tissue, demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy. By
enabling robust ST reconstruction from sparse inputs, our framework
significantly reduces reliance on costly high resolution data, facilitating
potential broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Transforming in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging into a
tool for spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions
requires automated, high-precision semantic segmentation of dynamically
evolving features. However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic
segmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data,
visually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning
architecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change
detection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net
backbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively
utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN
utilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between
physical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ
environmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN
demonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models,
particularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN
achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models
in predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges
several key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis,
advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental
settings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in
recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected
through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and
privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use
of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models
typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common
limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire
synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause
overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we
propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets
generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces
model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and
demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by
emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models
trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of
these benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational
complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.
Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,
which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.
Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated
from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,
ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use
unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information
required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection
networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box
and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set
from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and
category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate
task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the
performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on
the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated
approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional
photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due
to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These
challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of
annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning
model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we
examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for
natural images.
  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization,
semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable
cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement
cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which
can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we
introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation
accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we
found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate,
which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset
used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only
achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Faithfulness and interpretability are essential for deploying deep neural
networks (DNNs) in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging. B-cos
networks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a
weight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,
class-specific explanations without post-hoc methods. While maintaining
diagnostic performance competitive with state-of-the-art DNNs, standard B-cos
models suffer from severe aliasing artifacts in their explanation maps, making
them unsuitable for clinical use where clarity is essential. In this work, we
address these limitations by introducing anti-aliasing strategies using
FLCPooling (FLC) and BlurPool (BP) to significantly improve explanation
quality. Our experiments on chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that the modified
$\text{B-cos}_\text{FLC}$ and $\text{B-cos}_\text{BP}$ preserve strong
predictive performance while providing faithful and artifact-free explanations
suitable for clinical application in multi-class and multi-label settings. Code

            <p class="paper-summary">Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.</p>

limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability
in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot
scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges:
reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we
propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key
modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for
semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module
for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction
(FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four

complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual
Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf
visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack
of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a
diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent
interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks
where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific
questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks
like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D
multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and
strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT
training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and
yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.
Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved
visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing
multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to
support development and evaluation of visual CoT.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Point cloud completion is crucial for 3D computer vision tasks in autonomous
driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, obtaining clean and complete
point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and
occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on
synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we
tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point
clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness,
we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which
highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions.
Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing
Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM)
that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and
model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets. The dataset and
code will be publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper presents DFR (Decompose, Fuse and Reconstruct), a novel framework
that addresses the fundamental challenge of effectively utilizing multi-modal
guidance in few-shot segmentation (FSS). While existing approaches primarily
rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or
dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information
available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed
approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate
visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The
DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a
hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via
SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes
audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a
fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across
visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic
interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path
Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from
tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.
Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both
synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p>

to integrate new content seamlessly, yet they struggle to maintain coherence in
both structure and style between inpainted regions and the surrounding
background. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce HarmonPaint, a
training-free inpainting framework that seamlessly integrates with the
attention mechanisms of diffusion models to achieve high-quality, harmonized
image inpainting without any form of training. By leveraging masking strategies
within self-attention, HarmonPaint ensures structural fidelity without model
retraining or fine-tuning. Additionally, we exploit intrinsic diffusion model
properties to transfer style information from unmasked to masked regions,
achieving a harmonious integration of styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of HarmonPaint across diverse scenes and styles, validating
its versatility and performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined
object categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone
objects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in
complex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video
segmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object
categories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object
category that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating
room video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows
and instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning
segmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural
language text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.
However, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain
contextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is
inadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,
disappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as
surgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural
phases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments
during surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of
temporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation
that requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become
contextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal
reasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets
would be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an
innovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present
TCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52
samples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote
sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior
capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of
high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several
works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.
However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the
quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,
while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose
a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for
generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate
distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using
Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs
generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate
these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from
multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,
including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two
VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an
image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP
and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed
the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only
4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches
across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or
even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be
released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Desktop accessibility metadata enables AI agents to interpret screens and
supports users who depend on tools like screen readers. Yet, many applications
remain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by
developers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS
offer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen
representation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element
detection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of
desktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically
create real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single
screenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to
detect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's
system-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of
data for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three
datasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element
detection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside
corresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,
achieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.
Crucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to
interpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce
Screen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous
agent task execution in macOS desktop environments. Using this benchmark, we
demonstrate that Screen2AX delivers a 2.2x performance improvement over native
accessibility representations and surpasses the state-of-the-art OmniParser V2
system on the ScreenSpot benchmark.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Images taken in low light often show color shift, low contrast, noise, and
other artifacts that hurt computer-vision accuracy. Retinex theory addresses
this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and
illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under
changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have
four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;
(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot
perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color
constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the
scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and
illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the
Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face
detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11
percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and
higher reflectance stability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.</p>

increasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training
models at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city
layout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely
replicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data
such as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and
physics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,
incorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and
environmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited
training samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target
environment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates
geo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building
segmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,
with median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This
scalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with
synthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the "model collapse" issue
in purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving
generalization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive
real-world annotations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring
individual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have
traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made
it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated
way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space
(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research
of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet
been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:
PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The
datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn
conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad
visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images
improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled
images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art
models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time
alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods
achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.
However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they
could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate
characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for
future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets
perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This
highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and
research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use
and further development.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Transformers and Mamba, initially invented for natural language processing,
have inspired backbone architectures for visual recognition. Recent studies
integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local
details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are
limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any
interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer
and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing
A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a
new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model
(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an
attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of
cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the
multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a
two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of
SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and
Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L
achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic
segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting
higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade
Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while
having 40% less parameters. Code is publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Reliable end-to-end clinical report generation has been a longstanding goal
of medical ML research. The end goal for this process is to alleviate
radiologists' workloads and provide second opinions to clinicians or patients.
Thus, a necessary prerequisite for report generation models is a strong general
performance and some type of innate grounding capability, to convince
clinicians or patients of the veracity of the generated reports. In this paper,
we present ASaRG (\textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{S}egmentation-\textbf{a}ssisted
\textbf{R}eport \textbf{G}eneration), an extension of the popular LLaVA
architecture that aims to tackle both of these problems. ASaRG proposes to fuse
intermediate features and fine-grained segmentation maps created by specialist
radiological models into LLaVA's multi-modal projection layer via simple
concatenation. With a small number of added parameters, our approach achieves a
+0.89\% performance gain ($p=0.012$) in CE F1 score compared to the LLaVA
baseline when using only intermediate features, and +2.77\% performance gain
($p<0.001$) when adding a combination of intermediate features and fine-grained
segmentation maps. Compared with COMG and ORID, two other report generation
methods that utilize segmentations, the performance gain amounts to 6.98\% and
6.28\% in F1 score, respectively. ASaRG is not mutually exclusive with other
changes made to the LLaVA architecture, potentially allowing our method to be
combined with other advances in the field. Finally, the use of an arbitrary
number of segmentations as part of the input demonstrably allows tracing
elements of the report to the corresponding segmentation maps and verifying the
groundedness of assessments. Our code will be made publicly available at a
later date.</p>

accuracy plays a crucial role in the perception pipeline, as any errors can
have implications for the safety of the vehicle. Modern sensor systems collect
different types of data from the environment, making it harder to align the

cross-calibration between LiDARs and cameras with limited prior knowledge using
a custom ChArUco board and a tailored nonlinear optimization method. We test

from Cine MRI sequences remains a critical challenge. Existing methods
typically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the
ventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents. We
introduce a self-supervised framework, namely Codebook-based Temporal-Spatial
Learning (CTSL), that learns dynamic, spatiotemporal representations from raw
Cine data without requiring segmentation masks. CTSL decouples temporal and
spatial features through a multi-view distillation strategy, where the teacher
model processes multiple Cine views, and the student model learns from
reduced-dimensional Cine-SA sequences. By leveraging codebook-based feature
representations and dynamic lesion self-detection through motion cues, CTSL
captures intricate temporal dependencies and motion patterns. High-confidence
MACE risk predictions are achieved through our model, providing a rapid,
non-invasive solution for cardiac risk assessment that outperforms traditional
contrast-dependent methods, thereby enabling timely and accessible heart
disease diagnosis in clinical settings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for evaluating cardiac
function. While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture
detailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D
cardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of
myocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can
be broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its
limitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep
learning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological
consistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based
methods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation
(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation
with implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes
cardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need
for extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through
differentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous
motion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both
topological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC
dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep
learning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy. The

            <p class="paper-summary">Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a
classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually
restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To
resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework
for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to
identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations.
The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an
extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which
achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments.
Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal
attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in
the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality
deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery
localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised
learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at
enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing
that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows,
addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such
as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and
intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis
network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which
employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over
synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers.
Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to
speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall
structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process
incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information
consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing
pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging
datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images
with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the
contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale

            <p class="paper-summary">When preoperative planning for surgeries is conducted on the basis of medical
images, artificial intelligence methods can support medical doctors during
assessment. In this work, we consider medical guidelines for preoperative
planning of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and identify
tasks, that may be supported via semantic segmentation models by making
relevant anatomical structures measurable in computed tomography scans. We
first derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained
anatomical information, in order to train segmentation models and quantify how
well they are able to find these structures in the scans. Furthermore, we
propose an adaptation to the loss function in training these segmentation
models and through this achieve a +1.27% Dice increase in performance. Our
fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels and the computed tomography scans we
build upon are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16274176.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Reliable recognition and localization of surgical instruments in endoscopic
video recordings are foundational for a wide range of applications in computer-
and robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS), including surgical
training, skill assessment, and autonomous assistance. However, robust
performance under real-world conditions remains a significant challenge.
Incorporating surgical context - such as the current procedural phase - has
emerged as a promising strategy to improve robustness and interpretability.
  To address these challenges, we organized the Surgical Procedure Phase,
Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) sub-challenge as part of the
Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) challenge at MICCAI 2024. We introduced a novel,
multi-center dataset comprising thirteen full-length laparoscopic
cholecystectomy videos collected from three distinct medical institutions, with
unified annotations for three interrelated tasks: surgical phase recognition,
instrument keypoint estimation, and instrument instance segmentation. Unlike
existing datasets, ours enables joint investigation of instrument localization
and procedural context within the same data while supporting the integration of
temporal information across entire procedures.
  We report results and findings in accordance with the BIAS guidelines for
biomedical image analysis challenges. The PhaKIR sub-challenge advances the
field by providing a unique benchmark for developing temporally aware,
context-driven methods in RAMIS and offers a high-quality resource to support
future research in surgical scene understanding.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed
at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene
understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer
algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the
reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale
and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly
regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in
HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict
constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the
shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough
software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks
efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to
inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant
computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the
intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,
must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task
communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This
work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a
DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at
ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task
distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a
complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly
reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations
and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up
in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation
accuracy.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,
scaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of
square kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address
this through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.
First, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,
consisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across
the U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene
provides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic
segmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain
diversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored
framework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent
diffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)
Dual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D
Gaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the
costly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving
critical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models
trained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model
latent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely
large-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,
from semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain
synthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data
priors from Aerial-Earth3D. Our project page is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive
assessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment
environment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk
Management Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks
in seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and
manipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\&D, strategic deception and
scheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the "AI-$45^\circ$ Law,"
we evaluate these risks using "red lines" (intolerable thresholds) and "yellow
lines" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk
for routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring
strengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating
suspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that
all recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without
crossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for
cyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\&D risks. For self-replication, and
strategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except
for certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and
manipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective
influence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule
out the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although
detailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further
claims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and
urges collective action to mitigate these challenges.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">New era has unlocked exciting possibilities for extending Large Language
Models (LLMs) to tackle 3D vision-language tasks. However, most existing 3D
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or
segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their
spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent
in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D
MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language
tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM
integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that
progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,
generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.
Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and
3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate
the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate
that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range
of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our
progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial
information. Our code is available at

text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow
understanding and reasoning and allow models to exploit global context, failing
to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning. We present
CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with
leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal
a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning.
CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in robust and
interpretable video reasoning.</p>

necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task
complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent
self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible
solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods
augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data
complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual
descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,
leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched
difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,
closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data
and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,
C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model
evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex
multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with
iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively
selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to
conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
Consequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and
consistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be
released.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning-based classification of herbarium images is hampered by
background heterogeneity, which introduces noise and artifacts that can
potentially mislead models and reduce classification accuracy. Addressing these
background-related challenges is critical to improving model performance. We
introduce PlantSAM, an automated segmentation pipeline that integrates YOLOv10
for plant region detection and the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) for
segmentation. YOLOv10 generates bounding box prompts to guide SAM2, enhancing
segmentation accuracy. Both models were fine-tuned on herbarium images and
evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient metrics.
PlantSAM achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with an IoU of
0.94 and a Dice coefficient of 0.97. Incorporating segmented images into
classification models led to consistent performance improvements across five
tested botanical traits, with accuracy gains of up to 4.36% and F1-score
improvements of 4.15%. Our findings highlight the importance of background
removal in herbarium image analysis, as it significantly enhances
classification accuracy by allowing models to focus more effectively on the
foreground plant structures.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical
questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting
with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or
advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying
robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since
participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots.
In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that
enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support
meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112
participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos
from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The
experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise
on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM
reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more
pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human
condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences
the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest,
while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations.
Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those
without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and
interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative
robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight
the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback,
supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic
systems tailored to diverse populations.</p>

whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly,
to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based
thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly,
we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity
through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention
mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to
contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various
types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density
modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture
models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$
and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a
concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on
TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than

            <p class="paper-summary">Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow
removal (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered
by non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,
traditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details
and maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and
blurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall
viewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,
approaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize
restoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)
deep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve
ambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration
via a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive
component processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for
consistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for
fine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent
restoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are
effectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both
consistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits
of our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on

capabilities in 3D perception. However, extending these models to large-scale
RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. In
this work, we propose VGGT-Long, a simple yet effective system that pushes the
limits of monocular 3D reconstruction to kilometer-scale, unbounded outdoor
environments. Our approach addresses the scalability bottlenecks of existing
models through a chunk-based processing strategy combined with overlapping
alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without requiring camera
calibration, depth supervision or model retraining, VGGT-Long achieves
trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods. We
evaluate our method on KITTI, Waymo, and Virtual KITTI datasets. VGGT-Long not
only runs successfully on long RGB sequences where foundation models typically
fail, but also produces accurate and consistent geometry across various
conditions. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging foundation models

            <p class="paper-summary">Obtaining pixel-level annotations in the medical domain is both expensive and
time-consuming, often requiring close collaboration between clinical experts
and developers. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage
limited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate
segmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to
structure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by
pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint
into the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion
process by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than
explicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class
prototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.
This strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the
presence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available
benchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),
which provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for
multiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive
experiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under
the semi-supervised learning setting. This work presents a robust and

            <p class="paper-summary">Soft augmentation regularizes the supervised learning process of image
classifiers by reducing label confidence of a training sample based on the
magnitude of random-crop augmentation applied to it. This paper extends this
adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations
beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label
smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing.
However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image
transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive
label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest
that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data
distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation
types.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, interest in automatic train operations has significantly
increased. To enable advanced functionalities, robust vision-based algorithms
are essential for perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment.
However, the railway sector suffers from a lack of publicly available
real-world annotated datasets, making it challenging to test and validate new
perception solutions in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce
SynDRA-BBox, a synthetic dataset designed to support object detection and other
vision-based tasks in realistic railway scenarios. To the best of our
knowledge, is the first synthetic dataset specifically tailored for 2D and 3D
object detection in the railway domain, the dataset is publicly available at
https://syndra.retis.santannapisa.it. In the presented evaluation, a
state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation method, originally developed
for automotive perception, is adapted to the railway context, enabling the
transferability of synthetic data to 3D object detection. Experimental results
demonstrate promising performance, highlighting the effectiveness of synthetic
datasets and domain adaptation techniques in advancing perception capabilities
for railway environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Sparse-view 3D reconstruction is essential for applications in which dense
image acquisition is impractical, such as robotics, augmented/virtual reality
(AR/VR), and autonomous systems. In these settings, minimal image overlap
prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as
structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey
reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its
regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian
Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and
vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization,
explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate
artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings.
Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the
reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous
reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural
implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent
challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline
future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving
real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of
sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image
forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been
extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered
regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and
structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack
sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their
practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery
localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and
integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the
DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT
feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much
improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.
Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the
localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,
noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a
pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually
enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net
demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of
distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in
the last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations
(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against
the system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised
subject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial
transactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation
attacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)
approaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection
performances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown
presentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during
training), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,
this paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the
effectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and
challenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective
framework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are
able to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the
more advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training
sets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing
foundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art
observed with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which
contains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks</p>

variations; and (3) a positive-sample mixup strategy for efficiently leveraging
multiple fMRI scans associated with the same visual stimulus. Collectively,
these innovations enhance reconstruction accuracy, biological interpretability,

            <p class="paper-summary">Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling
cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial
objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for
astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency,
object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding
ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset
containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide
celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution
observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated
through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic
development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community,
STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view.
Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR)
model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images
from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by
24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our
method for astrophysics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method and the value of our dataset. Code and models are available

unconstrained and complex environments, particularly due to perspective
distortions caused by various shooting angles and the correction of single-line
and double-line license plates. Considering the limited computational resources
of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for
both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and
efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network
named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which
combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized
license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the
recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the
correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To
enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,
including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar
characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during
training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of
LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line
license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various
challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method
runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and
broad applicability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy
where deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis can enhance
clinical assessments.However, existing publicly available OSCC datasets often
suffer from limited patient cohorts and a restricted focus on either diagnostic
or prognostic tasks, limiting the development of comprehensive and
generalizable models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new
histopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both
diagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each
patient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at
x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the
core and edge tumor regions.The Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six
critical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis
(LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE),
and perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically
evaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion
techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our
analysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve
excellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and
81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization
benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3)
Multi-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to
single-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of
balancing multiple tasks in our dataset. To accelerate future research, we
publicly release the Multi-OSCC dataset and baseline models at

            <p class="paper-summary">The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies
of user behavior. In this work, we introduce HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for
personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400
videos across 170 semantic categories. To validate our dataset, we propose
HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict
preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing generic and
query-based approaches, showcasing its potential for highly user-centric video
highlighting in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)
of an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to
severe label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the
need for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be
computationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online
settings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on
the Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence
during inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label
imbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel
regularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.
Extensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with
transformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test
schemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and
efficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length
videos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets
for computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy
mp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in
streaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a
vanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR. We will publicly
release the source code of Mamba-OTR to support future research.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by
transferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while
preserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either
implicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large
pose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial
landmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model
(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose
changes. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial
keypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion
and to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the
degradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)
that maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a
pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of
facial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping
correction and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that
FRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose
accuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging
scenarios with extreme pose variations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet
traditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability
and domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on
large-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and
error-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation
models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong
generalizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,
effectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's
prompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since
manually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework
based on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated
image, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional
annotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation
(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to
adapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead
of dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for
iterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.
Extensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.
Notably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by
11.44%.</p>

Detection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the
lens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this
paper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and
resolution, affect the performance of state-of-the-art STDR algorithms in
real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under
controlled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST
with PyTesseract. Our findings reveal that resolution and distance
significantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less
predictable role. Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing
technique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further
demonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise
processing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones. This work not only
benchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions but also lays the
groundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. Our contributions aim to
inspire future research in robust, context-sensitive text recognition for

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters,
text-to-image (T2I) generative models are still susceptible to producing
harmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious
concerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which
aims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs
from the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential
external safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly
recognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before
real-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often
treat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which
limits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to
automatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.
Unlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly
models the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic
prompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and
diversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve
this without direct access to representative training samples, we draw
inspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple
and tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient
optimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long
and potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is
validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9
state-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I
models and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.</p>

complex environments. Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm,
relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations.
Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive
bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make
the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model
(M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from
large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new
insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies
into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information
imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity
(CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then
we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible,
easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive
experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for
four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing text-to-video methods struggle to transfer motion smoothly from a
reference object to a target object with significant differences in appearance
or structure between them. To address this challenge, we introduce MotionShot,
a training-free framework capable of parsing reference-target correspondences
in a fine-grained manner, thereby achieving high-fidelity motion transfer while
preserving coherence in appearance. To be specific, MotionShot first performs
semantic feature matching to ensure high-level alignments between the reference
and target objects. It then further establishes low-level morphological
alignments through reference-to-target shape retargeting. By encoding motion
with temporal attention, our MotionShot can coherently transfer motion across
objects, even in the presence of significant appearance and structure
disparities, demonstrated by extensive experiments. The project page is

            <p class="paper-summary">Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,
yet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.
Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from
input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and
point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often
fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical
applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly
models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable
joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model
designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of
downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively
build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically
invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder
backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to
maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.
By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,
Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface
normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to
multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that
supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D
prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) aims to classify human actions in videos
with only a small number of labeled samples per category. The scarcity of
training data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,
particularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion
dynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are
critical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action
labels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a
novel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden
beneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA
effectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into
sequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of
action (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments
actions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of
actions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual
features at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.
Finally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both
video-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.
Experimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multipe FSAR benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a
method that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during
parameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological
plausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these
challenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing
independent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,
because gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,
performance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from
supplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and
facilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary
Network++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by
employing the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent
blocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,
updated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.
Notably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal
due to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we
introduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby
further improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments
on tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental
results demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end
training while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++
offers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable
alternative to conventional training methods.</p>

models, the fundamental interplay between capacity, sparsity, and robustness in
low-capacity networks remains a vital area of study. We introduce a controlled
framework to investigate these properties by creating a suite of binary
classification tasks from the MNIST dataset with increasing visual difficulty
(e.g., 0 and 1 vs. 4 and 9). Our experiments reveal three core findings. First,
the minimum model capacity required for successful generalization scales
directly with task complexity. Second, these trained networks are robust to
extreme magnitude pruning (up to 95% sparsity), revealing the existence of
sparse, high-performing subnetworks. Third, we show that over-parameterization
provides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.
Interpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these
identified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the
original dense models. This work provides a clear, empirical demonstration of
the foundational trade-offs governing simple neural networks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is
essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial
and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain
and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most
existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting
their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the
disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,
they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain
analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework
that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to
enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense
convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency
module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a
novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial
feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines
and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and
AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various
vision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards
less important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance
the efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle
unimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.
Considering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,
tokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt
transformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a
balance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing
(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and
temporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a
later stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token
identification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By
jointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware
end-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each
block, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of
LV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a
better trade-off between performance and complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Defending pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, against
adversarial attacks is crucial, as these models are widely used in diverse
zero-shot tasks, including image classification. However, existing adversarial
training (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of
language in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT
methods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial
perturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,
and (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against
practical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.
To address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial
Fine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to
guide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This
enables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image
features even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across
diverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods
-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised
AT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean
accuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our
comprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in
enhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in
addition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness. Our findings
point to an urgent direction for future work -- centering high-quality
linguistic supervision in robust visual representation learning.</p>

to object detection models trained on conventional datasets. In this work, we
propose a data-centric pipeline that systematically improves detection
performance by focusing on the key question of identifying the blind spots of
the model. Through detailed error analysis, we identify critical edge-cases
such as confusing class pairs, peripheral distortions, and underrepresented
contexts. Then we directly address them through edge-case synthesis. We
fine-tuned an image generative model and guided it with carefully crafted
prompts to produce images that replicate real-world failure modes. These
synthetic images are pseudo-labeled using a high-quality detector and
integrated into training. Our approach results in consistent performance gains,
highlighting how deeply understanding data and selectively fixing its
weaknesses can be impactful in specialized domains like fisheye object
detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation
has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular,
the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand
for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user
intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video
generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,
multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it
challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current
models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of
additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human
pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable
video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical
applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we
provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both
theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by
introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation
models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,
analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the
denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods
based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition
generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

            <p class="paper-summary">With the increasing resolution of remote sensing imagery (RSI), large-size
RSI has emerged as a vital data source for high-precision vector mapping of
geographic objects. Existing methods are typically constrained to processing
small image patches, which often leads to the loss of contextual information
and produces fragmented vector outputs. To address these, this paper introduces
HoliTracer, the first framework designed to holistically extract vectorized
geographic objects from large-size RSI. In HoliTracer, we enhance segmentation
of large-size RSI using the Context Attention Net (CAN), which employs a
local-to-global attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies.
Furthermore, we achieve holistic vectorization through a robust pipeline that
leverages the Mask Contour Reformer (MCR) to reconstruct polygons and the
Polygon Sequence Tracer (PST) to trace vertices. Extensive experiments on
large-size RSI datasets, including buildings, water bodies, and roads,
demonstrate that HoliTracer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code and
data are available in https://github.com/vvangfaye/HoliTracer.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have
enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a
single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free
form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly
reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and
editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers
from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains
multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation
analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the
cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts
between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In
response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that
leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to
dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS
enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training
or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image
editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of
our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing
methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The Federated Domain Generalization for Person re-identification (FedDG-ReID)
aims to learn a global server model that can be effectively generalized to
source and target domains through distributed source domain data. Existing
methods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,
which to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.
However, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization
performance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the
model's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on
this, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the
positive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and
Continuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization
Gain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and
accumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory
recognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.
Furthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make
full use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our
approach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive
styles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This
training strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of
new styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough
utilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's
generalization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing methods in both the source domain and the target
domain.</p>

every year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of
accessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us
to monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been
advances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite
imagery analysis, However, they remain limited by their narrow focus on
specific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of
datasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations
for tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal
dataset of more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite
imagery and natural language annotations from news articles, accompanied by
geotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning

object detection. To address the sparsity of point clouds, previous approaches
typically construct spatial pseudo point clouds via depth completion as
auxiliary input and adopts a proposal-refinement framework to generate
detection results. However, introducing pseudo points inevitably brings noise,
potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. Considering the differing
roles and reliability levels of each modality, we propose LDRFusion, a novel
Lidar-dominant two-stage refinement framework for multi-sensor fusion. The
first stage soley relies on LiDAR to produce accurately localized proposals,
followed by a second stage where pseudo point clouds are incorporated to detect
challenging instances. The instance-level results from both stages are
subsequently merged. To further enhance the representation of local structures
in pseudo point clouds, we present a hierarchical pseudo point residual
encoding module, which encodes neighborhood sets using both feature and
positional residuals. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our

            <p class="paper-summary">Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,
encompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized
into four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and
instruction type. Notably, existing researches often focus solely on a limited
subset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability
and versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we
present MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework
incorporating Visual Large Language Model. Our framework is designed to
integrate both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks alongside box and
mask predictions within a single architecture. MVP-LM features an innovative
multi-granularity decoder in conjunction with a CoT-inspired dataset
unification strategy, enabling seamless supervised fine-tuning across a wide
spectrum of tasks, including but not limited to panoptic segmentation,
detection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation. Furthermore, we
introduce a query enhancement strategy aimed at harnessing the decoding and
generative capabilities inherent in VLLMs. Extensive experiments conducted
across a range of benchmarks in both word-based and sentence-based perception
tasks substantiate the efficacy of our framework. The code will be available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint
recognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this
distortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,
fingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial
registration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching
points. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of
detected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial
registration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration
process to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step
fingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly
predicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two
fingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration
failure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end
pixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only
single-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense
registration algorithms for further performance improvements.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image
modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle
to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original
image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation
benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human
perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image
Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human
preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes
1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+
edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion
scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+
question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs
to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide
insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability
and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for
evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment,
attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner.
Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and
aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets
also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are

            <p class="paper-summary">Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal
consistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream
tracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical
information without explicitly supervising the association process, making it
difficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate
this problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises
context reasoning via three core mechanisms. \textit{1) Context Reasoning
Mechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting
unconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that
predicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby
enhancing temporal consistency. \textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:
Utilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,
guiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and
suppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \textit{3) Efficient State
Modeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core
features of the target, removing redundant information across frames and
preventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms
collaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association
divergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that
RSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
while maintaining real-time running speeds. Our code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has
demonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear
complexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its
adaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance
the global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,
they tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense
prediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local
features as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question
that merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,
AtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local
details with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,
our method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a
gradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design
shortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to
effectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By
leveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design
dedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)
and semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,
respectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the
proposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and
Mamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only
captures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves
fine-grained local details.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Semantic segmentation in remote sensing (RS) has advanced significantly with
the incorporation of multi-modal data, particularly the integration of RGB
imagery and the Digital Surface Model (DSM), which provides complementary
contextual and structural information about the ground object. However,
integrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased
computational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded
segmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues
undermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly
in complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is
essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal
Network (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and
efficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM
input pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder
(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific
characteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich
contextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse
structural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric
Prior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion
process, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.
Additionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal
compatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence
minimization. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets
demonstrate that AMMNet attains state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy among
multi-modal networks while reducing computational and memory requirements.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in
text-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative
denoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early
denoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and
upscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues
arise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to
degraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\bf Latent Space
Scaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling
directly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without
altering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency
and visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our
comprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality
shows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.
When generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\%

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis, but its
application to online long-sequence scenarios is still limited. Existing
methods either rely on slow per-scene optimization or fail to provide efficient
incremental updates, hindering continuous performance. In this paper, we
propose LongSplat, an online real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction framework
designed for long-sequence image input. The core idea is a streaming update
mechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while
selectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this
mechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that
encodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR
simultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical
Gaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable
online reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without

            <p class="paper-summary">We present Livatar, a real-time audio-driven talking heads videos generation
framework. Existing baselines suffer from limited lip-sync accuracy and
long-term pose drift. We address these limitations with a flow matching based
framework. Coupled with system optimizations, Livatar achieves competitive
lip-sync quality with a 8.50 LipSync Confidence on the HDTF dataset, and
reaches a throughput of 141 FPS with an end-to-end latency of 0.17s on a single
A10 GPU. This makes high-fidelity avatars accessible to broader applications.

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial but challenging
due to anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric
data. Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art
results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a
Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance
segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key
innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that
enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale
Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via
multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available
benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that
MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of
87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing
leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and
ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and
computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm
the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components. Results suggest
that MLRU++ offers a practical and high-performing solution for 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. Source code is available at:

use learnable lattice filter banks to preserve both low- and high-frequency

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by
fundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid
synchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep
variables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have
sought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational
inefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,
we present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep
adaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video
diffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means
it fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA
Wan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --
surpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\leq$ 1/200 of the training
cost (\$500 vs. $\geq$ \$100,000) and $\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.
$\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)
generation, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\% (vs. 86.86\% of
Wan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as
start-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.
Meanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic
analyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative
priors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial
explosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,
efficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,
democratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.

            <p class="paper-summary">Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects
are used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered
significant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer
from three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,
motorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference
human identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are
unnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to
overcome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing
personalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,
human-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point
estimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose
timestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon
whether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as
gaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the
generated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three
benchmark datasets.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL) and radiomics-based
methods, is increasingly used for cancer outcome prediction with PET and SPECT
imaging. However, the comparative performance of handcrafted radiomics features
(HRF), deep radiomics features (DRF), DL models, and hybrid fusion approaches
remains inconsistent across clinical applications. This systematic review
analyzed 226 studies published from 2020 to 2025 that applied ML to PET or
SPECT imaging for outcome prediction. Each study was evaluated using a 59-item
framework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation
methods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including
model type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as
accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally
outperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and
sensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while
fusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant
differences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common
limitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data
(29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI
standards. These findings highlight the need for standardized pipelines,
improved data quality, and explainable AI to support clinical integration.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),
and their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the
emergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world
applications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where
intermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix
computed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find
that existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic
information to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find
CNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,
e.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the
high-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we
propose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption
(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX
on the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial
features. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt
both semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.
Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and
are highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,
developmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of
Spelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when
acted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic
causal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like
manipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object
concept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of
well-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke
segments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual
world models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet
supports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the
motion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)
the expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.
These concepts are used for "statistical counterfactual probing", where diverse
"virtual pokes" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the
resultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as
statistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet
outperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.
Finally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream
applications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for
physical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object
manipulation models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">User privacy in mobile robotics has become a critical concern. Existing
methods typically prioritize either the performance of downstream robotic tasks
or privacy protection, with the latter often constraining the effectiveness of
task execution. To jointly address both objectives, we study semantic-based
robot navigation in an ultra-low-resolution setting to preserve visual privacy.
A key challenge in such scenarios is recovering semantic segmentation from
ultra-low-resolution RGB images. In this work, we introduce a novel fully
joint-learning method that integrates an agglomerative feature extractor and a
segmentation-aware discriminator to solve ultra-low-resolution semantic
segmentation, thereby enabling privacy-preserving, semantic object-goal
navigation. Our method outperforms different baselines on ultra-low-resolution
semantic segmentation and our improved segmentation results increase the
success rate of the semantic object-goal navigation in a real-world
privacy-constrained scenario.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision transformers have emerged as a powerful tool across a wide range of
applications, yet their inner workings remain only partially understood. In
this work, we examine the phenomenon of massive tokens - tokens with
exceptionally high activation norms that act as attention sinks - and artifact
tokens that emerge as a byproduct during inference. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens mutually suppress one another through the attention mechanism,
playing a critical role in regulating information flow within the network.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce Fast Nystr\"om Attention (FNA), a
training-free method that approximates self-attention in linear time and space
by exploiting the structured patterns formed by massive and artifact tokens.
Additionally, we propose a masking strategy to mitigate noise from these
tokens, yielding modest performance gains at virtually no cost. We evaluate our
approach on popular pretrained vision backbones and demonstrate competitive
performance on retrieval, classification, segmentation, and visual question
answering (VQA), all while reducing computational overhead.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual object tracking and segmentation are becoming fundamental tasks for
understanding human activities in egocentric vision. Recent research has
benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric
vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However,
these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different
scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric
vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This
raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems
from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the
domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new
benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy
enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person
perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity
understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of
difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted
advancements on this task.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Traditional virtual try-on methods primarily focus on the garment-to-person
try-on task, which requires flat garment representations. In contrast, this
paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike
the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two
input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment
worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination
of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose
Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that
operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the
source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)
integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome
the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we
introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on
scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and

            <p class="paper-summary">Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for
quantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,
conventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture
the internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both
interpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We
propose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that
mirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of
applying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,
where each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration
correction. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer
kernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows
SAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration
coherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the
network. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the
network architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence
consistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.</p>

reliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening
applications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.
Low-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor
lighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly
degrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false
rejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight
yet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to
pre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification
pipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with
a Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an
accuracy of 96.67%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the face
verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,
including a comfortable 99.7% reduction in the false rejection rate and
enhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face
verification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on
a real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV
footage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of
poor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment
techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework
specifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:
variations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent
in practical surveillance scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical
for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to
computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel
quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion
classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost
modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for
robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference.
Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable
seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on
neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a
real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6\% Top-1 accuracy and
82.4\% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8\% / 81.7\% on the clinical dataset,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair
comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5\,ms
inference latency and 1.7\,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and
energy use by over 94.6\%/98.6\% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing
state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical
analysis in edge environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large
language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently,
diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though
their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where
training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they
significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.
Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation
loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as
implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse
distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed
left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and
derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which
diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not
compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to
the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions
to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current
reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as
hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature
of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally
forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI
Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that
models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface
plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point
rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions
centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment
by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target
regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance
mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.
This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to
dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich
gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.
Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro
benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of
24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides
superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to
unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI
interaction tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs
attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual
processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,
uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how
incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both
efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image
processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both
human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA
robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously
collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as
well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that
incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)
in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated
patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.
Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number
of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions
of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction
from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide
foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,
allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results
show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces
computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks
and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that
human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic
vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p>

of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,

fine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom
layers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid

profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for
text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of
existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in
detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the
existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate:
42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure,
restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False
Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on
combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness,
followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using
textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based
GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

            <p class="paper-summary">Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.</p>

neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.

            <p class="paper-summary">Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly

generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art

            <p class="paper-summary">State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity,
and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve
thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel
method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling
and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer
insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we
introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust
the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and
Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely
proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively
controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.
Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining
non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.
Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring
fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.
Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and
Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with
state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made

            <p class="paper-summary">Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

            <p class="paper-summary">Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a core task in computer vision. Multimodal
methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated
exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of
excessive parameter burden and insufficient ability to identify local distorted
features in CLIP for IQA, this study proposes a visual-language model knowledge
distillation method aimed at guiding the training of models with architectural
advantages using CLIP's IQA knowledge. First, quality-graded prompt templates
were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned
to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple
IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly
reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The proliferation of MultiLingual Visual Question Answering (MLVQA)
benchmarks augments the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
multi-modal LLMs, thereby enabling them to adeptly capture the intricate
linguistic subtleties and visual complexities inherent across diverse
languages. Despite its potential, the current MLVQA model struggles to fully
utilize its capabilities when dealing with the extensive variety of handwritten
documents. This article delineates HW-MLVQA, an avant-garde VQA benchmark
meticulously crafted to mitigate the dearth of authentic Multilingual
Handwritten document comprehension. HW-MLVQA encompasses an extensive
collection of 1,600 handwritten Pages complemented by 2,400 question-answers.
Furthermore, it provides a robust benchmark evaluation framework spanning three
distinct modalities: text, image, and an integrated image & text modality. To
simulate authentic real-world contexts devoid of ground truth textual
transcriptions, we facilitates a rigorous assessment of proprietary and
open-source OCR models. The benchmark aspires to facilitate pivotal
advancements in multilingual handwritten document interpretation, fostering
innovation and scholarly inquiry within this specialized domain.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.</p>

annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and
highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The
application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the
discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry
constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra
continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian
primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing
memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a
discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by
encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us
to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity
transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the
computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the
discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete
representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\eg Eikonal
loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and
enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based
consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher
relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding
complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method
outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Surface reconstruction and novel view rendering from sparse-view images are
challenging. Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based methods struggle with fine
details, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based approaches lack global
geometry coherence. We propose a novel hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance
3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details
of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses
state-of-the-art approaches in surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis
on the DTU and MobileBrick datasets. Code will be released at

            <p class="paper-summary">We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We
empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and
instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.
Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic
manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied. More details are

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical image segmentation is crucial for many healthcare tasks, including
disease diagnosis and treatment planning. One key area is the segmentation of
skin lesions, which is vital for diagnosing skin cancer and monitoring
patients. In this context, this paper introduces SegDT, a new segmentation
model based on diffusion transformer (DiT). SegDT is designed to work on
low-cost hardware and incorporates Rectified Flow, which improves the
generation quality at reduced inference steps and maintains the flexibility of
standard diffusion models. Our method is evaluated on three benchmarking
datasets and compared against several existing works, achieving
state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast inference speeds. This makes
the proposed model appealing for real-world medical applications. This work
advances the performance and capabilities of deep learning models in medical
image analysis, enabling faster, more accurate diagnostic tools for healthcare
professionals. The code is made publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.</p>

classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution,

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.</p>

metastatic sites, and forgo molecular information such as PD-L1
immunohistochemistry (IHC). To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data

this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

            <p class="paper-summary">Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.</p>

models often assume fixed, high-resolution inputs and degrade significantly
when faced with lower-resolution data in real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we propose RARE-UNet, a resolution-aware multi-scale segmentation
architecture that dynamically adapts its inference path to the spatial
resolution of the input. Central to our design are multi-scale blocks
integrated at multiple encoder depths, a resolution-aware routing mechanism,
and consistency-driven training that aligns multi-resolution features with
full-resolution representations. We evaluate RARE-UNet on two benchmark brain
imaging tasks for hippocampus and tumor segmentation. Compared to standard
UNet, its multi-resolution augmented variant, and nnUNet, our model achieves
the highest average Dice scores of 0.84 and 0.65 across resolution, while
maintaining consistent performance and significantly reduced inference time at
lower resolutions. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of
our architecture in achieving resolution-robust segmentation. The codes are

progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both

superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting

            <p class="paper-summary">Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based
on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from
the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning
and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their
advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal
data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in
complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain
vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex
chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic
data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning
data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of
reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training
strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and
Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims
to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable
subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for
improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the
typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft
reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity
in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks
and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental
results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain
methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g.,

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We report our recent progress towards building generalist robot policies, the
development of GR-3. GR-3 is a large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) model.
It showcases exceptional capabilities in generalizing to novel objects,
environments, and instructions involving abstract concepts. Furthermore, it can
be efficiently fine-tuned with minimal human trajectory data, enabling rapid
and cost-effective adaptation to new settings. GR-3 also excels in handling
long-horizon and dexterous tasks, including those requiring bi-manual
manipulation and mobile movement, showcasing robust and reliable performance.
These capabilities are achieved through a multi-faceted training recipe that
includes co-training with web-scale vision-language data, efficient fine-tuning
from human trajectory data collected via VR devices, and effective imitation
learning with robot trajectory data. In addition, we introduce ByteMini, a
versatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with exceptional flexibility and
reliability, capable of accomplishing a wide range of tasks when integrated
with GR-3. Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the
state-of-the-art baseline method, $\pi_0$, on a wide variety of challenging
tasks. We hope GR-3 can serve as a step towards building generalist robots
capable of assisting humans in daily life.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">After a family murder in rural Germany, authorities failed to locate the
suspect in a vast forest despite a massive search. To aid the search, a
research aircraft captured high-resolution aerial imagery. Due to dense
vegetation obscuring small clues, automated analysis was ineffective, prompting
a crowd-search initiative. This effort produced a unique dataset of labeled,
hard-to-detect anomalies under occluded, real-world conditions. It can serve as
a benchmark for improving anomaly detection approaches in complex forest
environments, supporting manhunts and rescue operations. Initial benchmark
tests showed existing methods performed poorly, highlighting the need for
context-aware approaches. The dataset is openly accessible for offline
processing. An additional interactive web interface supports online viewing and
dynamic growth by allowing users to annotate and submit new findings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Enabling efficient text-video retrieval on edge-end devices is critical for
real-world applications. Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in
balancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods
ensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while
salient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic
frame selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose
ProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with
significantly improved efficiency. We design a prompt-aware frame sampling
strategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual
prompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of
existing salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic
selection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy
that combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered
fine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving
accuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency
reduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e.,
R@1=49.0 in MSR-VTT dataset. Code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency
domain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in
medical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for
robust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose
DeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel
framework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse
spatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a
Decoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from
different MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction,
and a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet,
enabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion
characteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On
a six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1
accuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external
validation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On
a spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification
task, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal
and external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that
both DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over
10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the
potential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion
classification in multi-sequence medical imaging.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Surface defect detection of steel, especially the recognition of multi-scale
defects, has always been a major challenge in industrial manufacturing. Steel
surfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the
accuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex
environments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of
insufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small
target defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection
framework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the
C3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve
detection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to
reduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing
the spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to
enhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant
computations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,
the CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps
in a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures
detailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher accuracy and robustness in
steel surface defect detection tasks compared to other methods, effectively
addressing defect detection problems.</p>

real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits
object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware
framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual
objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs,
enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically
grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID
encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We
show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks,
but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene
editing. Project page: https://ruijiezhu94.github.io/ObjectGS_page</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels
presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic
disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but
they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow
recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this
work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for
hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We
develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates
local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a
disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which
infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances
are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement
learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during
lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time
disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract
transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe
wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time
flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in
aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on
the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,
circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and
fluid dynamics.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER
demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

            <p class="paper-summary">Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized
fine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in
preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this
work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented
as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for
achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a
partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the
shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within
the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending
algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a
progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate
blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited
version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing
the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques
across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original
shape and also adherence to the textual description.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most
informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in
resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which
focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the
learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of
Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that
characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,
coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a
predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the
estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across
different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and
self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes
effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting
full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals
crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the
scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective
strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays
the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of
AL in both research and real-world applications. The code is available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.</p>

problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized

and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction
tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground
segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and
inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our

detection where annotation requires specialized expertise. We present SynDiff,
a framework combining text-guided synthetic data generation with efficient
diffusion-based segmentation. Our approach employs latent diffusion models to
generate clinically realistic synthetic polyps through text-conditioned
inpainting, augmenting limited training data with semantically diverse samples.
Unlike traditional diffusion methods requiring iterative denoising, we
introduce direct latent estimation enabling single-step inference with T x
computational speedup. On CVC-ClinicDB, SynDiff achieves 96.0% Dice and 92.9%
IoU while maintaining real-time capability suitable for clinical deployment.
The framework demonstrates that controlled synthetic augmentation improves

            <p class="paper-summary">Pavement defect detection faces critical challenges including limited
annotated data, domain shift between training and deployment environments, and
high variability in defect appearances across different road conditions. We
propose RoadFusion, a framework that addresses these limitations through
synthetic anomaly generation with dual-path feature adaptation. A latent
diffusion model synthesizes diverse, realistic defects using text prompts and
spatial masks, enabling effective training under data scarcity. Two separate
feature adaptors specialize representations for normal and anomalous inputs,
improving robustness to domain shift and defect variability. A lightweight
discriminator learns to distinguish fine-grained defect patterns at the patch
level. Evaluated on six benchmark datasets, RoadFusion achieves consistently
strong performance across both classification and localization tasks, setting
new state-of-the-art in multiple metrics relevant to real-world road
inspection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">High-resolution volumetric computed tomography (CT) is essential for accurate
diagnosis and treatment planning in thoracic diseases; however, it is limited
by radiation dose and hardware costs. We present the Transformer Volumetric
Super-Resolution Network (\textbf{TVSRN-V2}), a transformer-based
super-resolution (SR) framework designed for practical deployment in clinical
lung CT analysis. Built from scalable components, including Through-Plane
Attention Blocks (TAB) and Swin Transformer V2 -- our model effectively
reconstructs fine anatomical details in low-dose CT volumes and integrates
seamlessly with downstream analysis pipelines. We evaluate its effectiveness on
three critical lung cancer tasks -- lobe segmentation, radiomics, and prognosis
-- across multiple clinical cohorts. To enhance robustness across variable
acquisition protocols, we introduce pseudo-low-resolution augmentation,
simulating scanner diversity without requiring private data. TVSRN-V2
demonstrates a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (+4\% Dice),
higher radiomic feature reproducibility, and enhanced predictive performance
(+0.06 C-index and AUC). These results indicate that SR-driven recovery of
structural detail significantly enhances clinical decision support, positioning
TVSRN-V2 as a well-engineered, clinically viable system for dose-efficient
imaging and quantitative analysis in real-world CT workflows.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.</p>

disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.</p>

applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental
challenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance
in such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense
representation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and
discriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.
Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding

            <p class="paper-summary">Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for
surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the
complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce
EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with
mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic
environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference
Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with
dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while
maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification
(HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores
using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization
despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive
softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that
modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement,
or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force
attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical
scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while
distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow
conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four
different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including
occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.
Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations
demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in
both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness
across challenging surgical conditions. The code, dataset, and video results
are available at https://szupc.github.io/EndoControlMag/.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the
detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection
methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks
on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.</p>

reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the
latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that
updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the

work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast

pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast

on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful

            <p class="paper-summary">Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we introduce MeshMamba, a neural network model for learning 3D
articulated mesh models by employing the recently proposed Mamba State Space
Models (Mamba-SSMs). MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large
number of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh
models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,

            <p class="paper-summary">Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) provide personalized in-silico cardiac
representations and hold great potential for precision medicine in cardiology.
However, whole-heart CDT models that simulate the full organ-scale
electromechanics of all four heart chambers remain limited. In this work, we
propose a weakly supervised learning model to reconstruct 4D (3D+t) heart mesh
directly from multi-view 2D cardiac cine MRIs. This is achieved by learning a
self-supervised mapping between cine MRIs and 4D cardiac meshes, enabling the
generation of personalized heart models that closely correspond to input cine
MRIs. The resulting 4D heart meshes can facilitate the automatic extraction of
key cardiac variables, including ejection fraction and dynamic chamber volume
changes with high temporal resolution. It demonstrates the feasibility of
inferring personalized 4D heart models from cardiac MRIs, paving the way for an
efficient CDT platform for precision medicine. The code will be publicly
released once the manuscript is accepted.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate representation of myocardial infarct geometry is crucial for
patient-specific cardiac modeling in MI patients. While Late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) MRI is the clinical gold standard for infarct detection, it
requires contrast agents, introducing side effects and patient discomfort.
Moreover, infarct reconstruction from LGE often relies on sparsely sampled 2D
slices, limiting spatial resolution and accuracy. In this work, we propose a
novel framework for automatically reconstructing high-fidelity 3D myocardial
infarct geometry from 2D clinically standard cine MRI, eliminating the need for
contrast agents. Specifically, we first reconstruct the 4D biventricular mesh
from multi-view cine MRIs via an automatic deep shape fitting model, biv-me.
Then, we design a infarction reconstruction model, CMotion2Infarct-Net, to
explicitly utilize the motion patterns within this dynamic geometry to localize
infarct regions. Evaluated on 205 cine MRI scans from 126 MI patients, our
method shows reasonable agreement with manual delineation. This study
demonstrates the feasibility of contrast-free, cardiac motion-driven 3D infarct
reconstruction, paving the way for efficient digital twin of MI.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate segmentation of pheochromocytoma (PCC) in abdominal CT scans is
essential for tumor burden estimation, prognosis, and treatment planning. It
may also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing.
This study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify
configurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed
the nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D
segmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class
schemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived
from adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,
kidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad
body-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested
on 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.
Performance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized
Surface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the
Tumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation
accuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)
annotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%
improvement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.
The TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)
and strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold
cross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1
to 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability. These findings
highlight the value of incorporating relevant anatomical context into deep
learning models to achieve precise PCC segmentation, offering a valuable tool
to support clinical assessment and longitudinal disease monitoring in PCC
patients.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Anemia is a widespread global health issue, particularly among young children
in low-resource settings. Traditional methods for anemia detection often
require expensive equipment and expert knowledge, creating barriers to early
and accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we explore the use of deep
learning models for detecting anemia through conjunctival pallor, focusing on
the CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59
months. The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age and other
demographic data, enabling the development of machine learning models for
accurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone,
known for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and
fine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques and a
cross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accuracy of
0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an F1 score of 0.9773 demonstrating strong
performance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge
devices, we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of
different bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model performance.
Preliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high
accuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370), and F1 Score (0.9377), more aggressive
quantization (INT8 and INT4) leads to significant performance degradation.
Overall, our study supports further exploration of quantization schemes and
hardware optimizations to assess trade-offs between model size, inference time,
and diagnostic accuracy in mobile healthcare applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results
highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous
vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.</p>

persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support,
and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions
neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health
workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled
Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure
patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on
small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage
with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we
integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor
analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with
KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL
and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To
optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8,
reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5
at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data
privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made

this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop
closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the

designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an

quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep

            <p class="paper-summary">Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and
reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high
computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET
image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep
diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between
diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling
the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a
score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve
computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was
adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The
proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets.
For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested
on amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.
For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one
[$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from
another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction
method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types,
providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET
imaging.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain
identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving
video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce
StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with
learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned
on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building
upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed
modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In
particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the
similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven
poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These
matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating
misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face
embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a
global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a
distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal
layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference
stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization
integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for
enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of
StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly
large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets.
This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor
generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper.
In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step
pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance.
More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a
single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite
datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral
information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only
simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on
full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite
loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for
pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny
model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior
performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized
models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled
engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass
brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards
creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for
pan-sharpening. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) techniques rely on either supervised
in-shop approaches, which ensure high fidelity but struggle with cross-domain
generalization, or unsupervised in-the-wild methods, which improve adaptability
but remain constrained by data biases and limited universality. A unified,
training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open
challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON
framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture
fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment
details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing
with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve
fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM
inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,
ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By
disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias
inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance
across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it
is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment
transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene. Code is available at

coral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset
bias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential
misinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware
AI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to
detect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across
varied underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to
optimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining
competitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100
show that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable
real-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,
uncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven
environmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,
WaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in
computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography
(USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered
waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally
intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for
quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative
approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their
effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets
oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a
large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between
theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes
8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million
frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a
comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward
simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,
scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and
extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing
innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in
real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate
efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.</p>

foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the
accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent
performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language

these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness
in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to
assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.
Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and
evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises
1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in
computer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has
significantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high
memory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in
real-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything
(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM
often generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.
Therefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline
curve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the
robust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a
four-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed
to effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the
visual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising
critical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical
utility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential
for FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial
automation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and
efficient edge recognition is crucial.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing
learning-based methods primarily rely on supervised regression with annotated
data without leveraging the inherent geometric properties in physical documents
to the dewarping process. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is
characterized by transforming distorted feature lines into axis-aligned ones.
This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid
geometry in planar documents. In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned
geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we
propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping
difficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned
Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with
human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,
our method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves
18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based
regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods
fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts
(e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating
behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over
image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts
perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic
understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based
Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification
with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address
discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates
manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only
images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts
dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts
containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage
cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to
prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We
demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that
MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical
biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual
context in multimodal regression tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate motion estimation in cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging is
critical for assessing cardiac function and surgical planning. Data-driven
methods have become the standard approach for dense motion estimation, but they
rely on vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth (GT) motion
annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain. To address this limitation,
we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of
cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations.
  Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which
incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained
to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the
generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that
simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle. These
pairs serve as fully annotated data samples, providing optical flow GT
annotations. Our data generation pipeline could enable the training and
validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models, allowing for
substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations.

            <p class="paper-summary">Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent
generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to
downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains
challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer
from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality
isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,
we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that
establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,
enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge
flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early
layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts
through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of
low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific
task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper
alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations
at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain
transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further
introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient
cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate
HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11
benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Low-overlap point cloud registration (PCR) remains a significant challenge in
3D vision. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as Maximum Inlier Count, become
ineffective under extremely low inlier ratios. In this paper, we revisit the
registration result evaluation problem and identify the Decision version of the
PCR task as the fundamental problem. To address this Decision PCR task, we
propose a data-driven approach. First, we construct a corresponding dataset
based on the 3DMatch dataset. Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained
to reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of
traditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to
address this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this
classifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,
existing state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced
registration performance. For example, combining our framework with
GeoTransformer achieves a new SOTA registration recall of 86.97\% on the

            <p class="paper-summary">Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained
by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural
properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence
that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a
context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank
Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes
derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a
shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only
the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching
and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing
latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption
and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset.

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper extends Cross Modal Generalization (CMG) to open-set environments
by proposing the more challenging Open-set Cross Modal Generalization (OSCMG)
task. This task evaluates multimodal unified representations in open-set
conditions, addressing the limitations of prior closed-set cross-modal
evaluations. OSCMG requires not only cross-modal knowledge transfer but also
robust generalization to unseen classes within new modalities, a scenario
frequently encountered in real-world applications. Existing multimodal unified
representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle
this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked
multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI
enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic
semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization.
CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating
modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby
strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set
tasks. Extensive experiments on CMG and the newly proposed OSCMG validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of
attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL
methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide
images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training.
Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating
instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the
bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions
among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various
mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially
overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this
work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability
distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local
interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven}
state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our
approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover,
the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are
interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM
due to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D
reconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that
leverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to
estimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.
We express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit
vector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the
concept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common
line estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM
projection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary
components: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based
on an $\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously
estimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm
and orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an
iterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane
translations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches
have leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation
recovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\ell_2$-based objectives
that are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only
approximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,
can lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR
regimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler
angle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell
Correlation (FSC).</p>

Image-to-3D content creation but requires substantial computational resources
and large datasets, posing challenges to training models from scratch. Current
methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance,
which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds.
To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D
Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using
a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated
point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry
and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS
object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality
reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our
approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and
practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality
outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D
content generation.</p>

Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional

contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper
proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image
classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is
utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based
attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image

            <p class="paper-summary">3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information
in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for
embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on
separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D
point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to
train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP
for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D
encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for
feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training
inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal
network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),
significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal
model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the
tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across
modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module
is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and
images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and
introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.
Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the
three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to
the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by
approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection
task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval
tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been
significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art
MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning
principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their
success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely
unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited
generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive
study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding
learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based
embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary
contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we
explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training
strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and
re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked
factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these
discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL
(\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al
via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art
competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings,
and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as
composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval. These results underscore
the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based

positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,
coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the
Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect
region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in
X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides
the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating
context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,
confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the
SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using
tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,
enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate
diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset
demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection
F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and
trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of
agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) captures cardiac signals from facial
videos and is gaining attention for its diverse applications. While deep
learning has advanced rPPG estimation, it relies on large, diverse datasets for
effective generalization. In contrast, handcrafted methods utilize
physiological priors for better generalization in unseen scenarios like motion
while maintaining computational efficiency. However, their linear assumptions
limit performance in complex conditions, where deep learning provides superior
pulsatile information extraction. This highlights the need for hybrid
approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. To address this, we
present BeatFormer, a lightweight spectral attention model for rPPG estimation,
which integrates zoomed orthonormal complex attention and frequency-domain
energy measurement, enabling a highly efficient model. Additionally, we
introduce Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL), which allows BeatFormer to be
trained without any PPG or HR labels. We validate BeatFormer on the PURE,
UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, demonstrating its robustness and performance,
particularly in cross-dataset evaluations under motion scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the emergence of foundation models for depth prediction has
led to remarkable progress, particularly in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their
outputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation
poses challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address
this, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation
models to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as
they require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,
fine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization
capabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,
we introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth
measurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into
metric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,
thereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation
models while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to
bridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional
computational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the
emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the
fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging
topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not
been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion
states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with
a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the
framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately
designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale
temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion
of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations
for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further
propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges
between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of
body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the
relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an
emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow
architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is
jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing
self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and
achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the
existing methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper investigates the problem of object detection with a focus on
improving both the localization accuracy of bounding boxes and explicitly
modeling prediction uncertainty. Conventional detectors rely on deterministic
bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model
robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement
framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth
distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter
high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a
simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.
Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively
integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further
extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability
of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks. Code

Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video

            <p class="paper-summary">Depth completion is an important vision task, and many efforts have been made
to enhance the quality of depth maps from sparse depth measurements. Despite
significant advances, training these models to recover dense depth from sparse
measurements remains a challenging problem. Supervised learning methods rely on
dense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised
approaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and
photometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is
costly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised
methods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only
sparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training. Unlike
existing methods, our approach eliminates the need for dense depth labels or
additional images captured from neighboring viewpoints. By leveraging the
characteristics of depth distribution, we design novel loss functions that
effectively propagate depth information from observed points to unobserved
regions. Additionally, we incorporate segmentation maps generated by vision
foundation models to further enhance depth estimation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and
industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a
significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both
object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D
scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality
textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout
optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and
inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the
input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets.
Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by
constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene
depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal
alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input.
Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer
distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout
parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains
precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on
multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture
fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages
in scene layout synthesis.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images
is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the
high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,
which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there
is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly
used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.
First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to
learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality
of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,
existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding
annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in
supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.
The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation
of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional
diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices
and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training
process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show
that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.
Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus
enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Image dehazing aims to remove unwanted hazy artifacts in images. Although
previous research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to
improve dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models
often experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world
hazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a
flexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during
testing. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than
recovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network
(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to
source-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to
update dehazing models for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce a Haze-Transfer-Consistency loss and a Content-Leakage Loss to
enhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability. Experimental results demonstrate
that PHATNet significantly boosts state-of-the-art dehazing models on benchmark
real-world image dehazing datasets.</p>

understanding. However, financial charts, characterized by complex temporal
structures and domain-specific terminology, remain notably underexplored. We
introduce FinChart-Bench, the first benchmark specifically focused on
real-world financial charts. FinChart-Bench comprises 1,200 financial chart
images collected from 2015 to 2024, each annotated with True/False (TF),
Multiple Choice (MC), and Question Answering (QA) questions, totaling 7,016
questions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LVLMs
on FinChart-Bench. Our evaluation reveals critical insights: (1) the
performance gap between open-source and closed-source models is narrowing, (2)
performance degradation occurs in upgraded models within families, (3) many
models struggle with instruction following, (4) both advanced models show
significant limitations in spatial reasoning abilities, and (5) current LVLMs
are not reliable enough to serve as automated evaluators. These findings
highlight important limitations in current LVLM capabilities for financial

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but
are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an
effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training
quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with
pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However,
existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific
heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with
industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines
complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists
of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures
structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale
quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations,
which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant
is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving
strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream
deployment tools.</p>

such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling
safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,
efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering
significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to
conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation
of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic
tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep
learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will
observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a
textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to
accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame
prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world
scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared
to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike
conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy
computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image
and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,
reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for
applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion
trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often
appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods.
Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in
multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In
this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to
analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of
human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in
social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely
on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal
gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we
introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face
in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that
\textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and
2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods
by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired
cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM
to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more
transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to
enhance defense against deepfakes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image
restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ
significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the
challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual
task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target
image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of
low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing
backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible
integration with various architectures and effective utilization of
task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a
unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across
multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we
extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity.
We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision
tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of
training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited
data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations
through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization,
few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the
model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and
potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general
low-level vision modeling.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in
handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models
for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction
(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to
handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical
aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,
stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can
accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite
tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric
aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of
the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results
show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very
sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with
completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher
computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose
estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and
large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric
complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully
replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,
especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance
but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature.
Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation
under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel
Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates
truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in
each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are
independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.
  Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation
fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.
  In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE
samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and
low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD
achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26
on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant
margin. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/EPD.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from
one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as
continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence
relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network
architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and
have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample
efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static
transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to
sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding
time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend
equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie
subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.
We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:
their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for
moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and
demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant
counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity
generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We
present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect
the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), downsampling operations are crucial
to model performance. Although traditional downsampling methods (such as
maximum pooling and cross-row convolution) perform well in feature aggregation,
receptive field expansion, and computational reduction, they may lead to the
loss of key spatial information in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby
affecting the pixel-by-pixel prediction accuracy.To this end, this study
proposes a downsampling method based on information complementarity - Hybrid
Pooling Downsampling (HPD). The core is to replace the traditional method with
MinMaxPooling, and effectively retain the light and dark contrast and detail
features of the image by extracting the maximum value information of the local
area.Experiment on various CNN architectures on the ACDC and Synapse datasets
show that HPD outperforms traditional methods in segmentation performance, and
increases the DSC coefficient by 0.5% on average. The results show that the HPD
module provides an efficient solution for semantic segmentation tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous
wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and
environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in
this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing
saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing
attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally
prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI
data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient
spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core
components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward
semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained
with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these
designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps
and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient
backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15
percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency
results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent
parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability
practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing
gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical
moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer
semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning
have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two
prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling
indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant
content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses
causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps
through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual
grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option
pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These
refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely
retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion
mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The
integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate
accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and
NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially
enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions
require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a
vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their
irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR
interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture
temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal
framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports
with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and
respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in
critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision
encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through
interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at
each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a
retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy
in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became
radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds
significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions
like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial
and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution
in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights
that can directly improve clinical outcomes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning models often hallucinate, producing realistic artifacts that
are not truly present in the sample. This can have dire consequences for
scientific and medical inverse problems, such as MRI and microscopy denoising,
where accuracy is more important than perceptual quality. Uncertainty
quantification techniques, such as conformal prediction, can pinpoint outliers
and provide guarantees for image regression tasks, improving reliability.
However, existing methods utilize a linear constant scaling factor to calibrate
uncertainty bounds, resulting in larger, less informative bounds. We propose
QUTCC, a quantile uncertainty training and calibration technique that enables
nonlinear, non-uniform scaling of quantile predictions to enable tighter
uncertainty estimates. Using a U-Net architecture with a quantile embedding,
QUTCC enables the prediction of the full conditional distribution of quantiles
for the imaging task. During calibration, QUTCC generates uncertainty bounds by
iteratively querying the network for upper and lower quantiles, progressively
refining the bounds to obtain a tighter interval that captures the desired
coverage. We evaluate our method on several denoising tasks as well as
compressive MRI reconstruction. Our method successfully pinpoints
hallucinations in image estimates and consistently achieves tighter uncertainty
intervals than prior methods while maintaining the same statistical coverage.</p>

video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)
models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,
existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic
scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal
dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct
VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models
for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of
real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into
10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering
spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other
critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on
InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained
spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally,
fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance
improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for

affecting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, individuals
from lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced
stages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid
conditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a
novel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical
deferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment
with three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully
connected layer as the most versatile methodology. We synthesize adversarial,
low-quality images and use contrastive learning to train the deferral system,
guiding the model to identify out-of-distribution samples that warrant
clinician review. By maintaining diagnostic accuracy on suboptimal images and
integrating critical health data, our system can improve early detection,
particularly in underserved populations where advanced DR is often first
identified. This approach may reduce healthcare costs, increase early detection
rates, and address disparities in access to care, promoting healthcare equity.</p>

practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration,
food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing
agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or
regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced
terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we
introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global
Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset
covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex
terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution

transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing

including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the
GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction
methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level

            <p class="paper-summary">Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce
unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant
updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with
minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves
scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks,
making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other
latency-sensitive applications.</p>

Estimating uncertainty for each prediction (i.e., confidence based on
probability density or quantile) is essential for safety-critical contexts like
human-robot collaboration to minimize risks. However, existing diverse motion
forecasting approaches struggle with uncertainty quantification due to implicit
probabilistic representations hindering uncertainty modeling. We propose
ProbHMI, which introduces invertible networks to parameterize poses in a
disentangled latent space, enabling probabilistic dynamics modeling. A
forecasting module then explicitly predicts future latent distributions,
allowing effective uncertainty quantification. Evaluated on benchmarks, ProbHMI
achieves strong performance for both deterministic and diverse prediction while
validating uncertainty calibration, critical for risk-aware decision making.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and
are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR
models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen
and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a
teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot
abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation
Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt
Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal
knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to
recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.
Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental
Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze
rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed
scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align
rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the
Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively
capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned
multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a
stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,
bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction
bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving
superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further
demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel
tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through
natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models.
Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to
balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains
underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we
propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal
WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust
task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific
accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task
allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch
and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through
internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge
bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the
final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on
multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs
and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains
inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets.
While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial
solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts,
multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this
work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to
support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes
diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real
question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the
dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately
handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments
demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and
efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting
a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a
scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant
implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However,
existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment
between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple
representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To
address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent
space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence
between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale
instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology
representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene
expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional
relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination
pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)
instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening
the alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and
structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal
representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across
diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial
transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art
performance in gene expression prediction. The code and checkpoints will be
released soon.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is
essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study
presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level
food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and
after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models
(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped
dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a
comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a
custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the
task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at
least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment
in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter
counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4
GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more
rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or
viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically
post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,
constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is
pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous
monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for
automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service
environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future
directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce
institutional food waste.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating
represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive
environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video
Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent
enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces
'FST.ai' -- which is developed under the 'R3AL.ai' project, which serves as its
Principal Investigator: r3al.ai -- a novel AI-powered framework designed to
enhance officiating in Sport Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex
task of real-time head kick detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision,
deep learning, and edge inference, the system automates the identification and
classification of key actions, significantly reducing decision time from
minutes to seconds while improving consistency and transparency. Importantly,
the methodology is not limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based
on pose estimation, motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be
adapted to a wide range of sports requiring action detection, such as judo,
karate, fencing, or even team sports like football and basketball, where foul
recognition or performance tracking is critical. By addressing one of
Taekwondo's most challenging scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate
the robustness, scalability, and sport-agnostic potential of 'FST.ai' to
transform officiating standards across multiple disciplines.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Generative data augmentation has demonstrated gains in several vision tasks,
but its impact on object re-identification - where preserving fine-grained
visual details is essential - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
assess the effectiveness of identity-preserving image generation for object
re-identification. Our novel pipeline, named PAT++, incorporates Diffusion
Self-Distillation into the well-established Part-Aware Transformer. Using the
Urban Elements ReID Challenge dataset, we conduct extensive experiments with
generated images used for both model training and query expansion. Our results
show consistent performance degradation, driven by domain shifts and failure to
retain identity-defining features. These findings challenge assumptions about
the transferability of generative models to fine-grained recognition tasks and
expose key limitations in current approaches to visual augmentation for
identity-preserving applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical
limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over
cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and
(2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity
present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these
issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed
MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving
efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction
mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch
inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information
with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter
branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain
cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing
in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing
multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy
both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive
experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our
MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object
detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general
and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even
without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T
semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its
generality. The source code will be available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video
synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation
through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved
from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic
media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their
single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately,
making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media
formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel
framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of
synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning
(RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage
Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and
substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging
state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark
comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts
using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and

            <p class="paper-summary">Reconstructing photo-realistic large-scale scenes from images, for example at
city scale, is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Neural rendering
is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from
previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering
methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene
because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed
for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for
reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of
geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view
synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit
use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene
(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,
implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids
explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational
cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the
scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth
information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex
scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is
independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines
geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering
large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than
using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach
can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep
learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific
designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a
streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new
opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting
these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets
for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and
the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose
DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a
Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective
fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike
existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully
exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and
segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)
and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior
performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically
exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and
tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction
applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing,
medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with
facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes
is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose
Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships
among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression
recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are
used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based
on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local
appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.
Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and
integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph
learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic
representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph
convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global
dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition
of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed
Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.
The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%,
respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong
generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and
real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for
practical facial expression recognition applications.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Processing data at high speeds is becoming increasingly critical as digital
economies generate enormous data. The current paradigms for timely data
processing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing
places resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing
analyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream
processing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource
provisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas
excess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as
threshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance
degrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime
adaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive
machine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that
minimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge
stream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts
the upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a
transfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online
stream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution
adaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains.
Finally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of
operator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource
constraints. The lightweight GRU model for load predictions recorded up to
1.3\% SMAPE value on a real-world data set. It outperformed CNN, ARIMA, and
Prophet on the SMAPE and RMSE evaluation metrics, with lower training time than
the computationally intensive RL models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring.
Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell
morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep
learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high
potential in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of blood image analysis.
However, a detailed performance analysis of specific deep learning frameworks
appears to be lacking. This paper compares the performance of three popular
deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow with Keras, PyTorch, and JAX, in
classifying blood cell images from the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset.
The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also
classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal
variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as
image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy
for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the
efficiency of these frameworks for medical image classification.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image
contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering
distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities
increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods
for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize
missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time
while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides
a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All
frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three
publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms
diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,
and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these
results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small
datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN
performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I
translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising
directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis. Code and

            <p class="paper-summary">The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such
as Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational
principle: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how
information flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of
self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural
language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an
affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)
as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based
weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS
defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature
relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this
perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a
single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token
similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise
relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie
in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention
within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several
strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical
foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The remarkable success of pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has led to a
proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge
presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable
pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge
lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the
underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning
dynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely
align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential
nonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a
finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD
proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution
toward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware
decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes
and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned
optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the
differential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively
bridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning
process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised
pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive
performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires
reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D
scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,
particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles
and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and
powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects
using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D
embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that
captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These
relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level
integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for
unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and
question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional
supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,
Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms
strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided
relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Clutter in photos is a distraction preventing photographers from conveying
the intended emotions or stories to the audience. Photography amateurs
frequently include clutter in their photos due to unconscious negligence or the
lack of experience in creating a decluttered, aesthetically appealing scene for
shooting. We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that
provides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We
estimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics
and content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify
clutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes
cluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with
different kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical
novelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment
algorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image
inpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs
missing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies
demonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate
algorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher
quality images within less time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">A fundamental challenge in affective cognitive science is to develop models
that accurately capture the relationship between external emotional stimuli and
human internal experiences. While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in
facial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual
differences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates
the phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit
significant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same
stimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we
hypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN
classifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.
To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling
method to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision
boundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,
constructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis
reveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual
uncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles
in emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using
behavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both
group-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns. Our findings
establish a systematic link between ANN decision boundaries and human
perceptual variability, offering new insights into personalized modeling of
emotional interpretation.</p>

people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign
language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the

properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole
world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have
become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent
studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign
over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser

            <p class="paper-summary">High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial Electroencephalography
(iEEG) are critical biomarkers for localizing the epileptogenic zone in
epilepsy treatment. However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer
from unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require
time-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been
used to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled
datasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized
expertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low
inter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across
institutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological
HFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we
leverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant
signals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the
Self-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of
candidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of
pathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for
morphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the
detected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision
for pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine
detection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on
large multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and
clinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy
detectors.</p>

AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical
requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly
demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and
professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA
methods demonstrate stronger perceptual and generalization capabilities
compared to traditional approaches, yet they suffer from modality bias
(score-only or text-only) and lack fine-grained attribute decomposition,
thereby failing to support further aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we
present:(1) ArtiMuse, an innovative MLLM-based IAA model with Joint Scoring and
Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first
expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main
categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with
8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score. Both the model and

            <p class="paper-summary">Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling
and pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space
by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection
accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low
precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D
annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To
eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we
propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for
consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.
Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting
achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded
scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.
Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise
during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.
Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians
and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting. Code is
available on the \href{https://jiahao-ma.github.io/DCHM/}{project page}.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In this paper, we formulate the knowledge distillation (KD) as a conditional
generative problem and propose the \textit{Generative Distribution Distillation
(GenDD)} framework. A naive \textit{GenDD} baseline encounters two major
challenges: the curse of high-dimensional optimization and the lack of semantic
supervision from labels. To address these issues, we introduce a \textit{Split
Tokenization} strategy, achieving stable and effective unsupervised KD.
Additionally, we develop the \textit{Distribution Contraction} technique to
integrate label supervision into the reconstruction objective. Our theoretical
proof demonstrates that \textit{GenDD} with \textit{Distribution Contraction}
serves as a gradient-level surrogate for multi-task learning, realizing
efficient supervised training without explicit classification loss on
multi-step sampling image representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we conduct experiments on balanced, imbalanced, and unlabeled data.
Experimental results show that \textit{GenDD} performs competitively in the
unsupervised setting, significantly surpassing KL baseline by \textbf{16.29\%}
on ImageNet validation set. With label supervision, our ResNet-50 achieves
\textbf{82.28\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in 600 epochs training,
establishing a new state-of-the-art.</p>

neuromorphic vision sensors. In contrast to traditional methods that rely
heavily on optical flow or explicit depth estimation, our approach exploits the
sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data and incorporates geometric
constraints between normal flow, scene structure, and inertial measurements.
The proposed optimization-based pipeline iteratively performs event
over-segmentation, isolates independently moving objects via residual analysis,
and refines segmentations using hierarchical clustering informed by motion
similarity and temporal consistency. Experimental results on the EVIMO2v2

            <p class="paper-summary">Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000
pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model
(MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous
methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification
using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the
generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent
MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly
into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To
address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA
(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token
compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that
aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,
inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are
forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length
and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that
TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing
training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Completing the whole 3D structure based on an incomplete point cloud is a
challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical
structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning
attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.
However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their
generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented
point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal
retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from
similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature
Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct
reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in
the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced
and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose
a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical
feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input
features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in
generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability
in handling sparse data and unseen categories.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers
(ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on
devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be
calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic
samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global
and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data
quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant
difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the
quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance
degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a
pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).
Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,
effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and
inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the
quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the
full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves
remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par
with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T
with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our
method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces
computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge
devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by
improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in
resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in dynamic and perceptually aliased
environments remains a fundamental challenge for long-term localization.
Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame
embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This
paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies
spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,
end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D
convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,
termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term
spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models
directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing
kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,
yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance
shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a
quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative
divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal
aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings
directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint
variations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The dissemination of visualizations is primarily in the form of raster
images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source
code, interactive features, and metadata. While previous methods have proposed
embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval
(VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to
common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing.
To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework
that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data
link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We
propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data
tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for
crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive
chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval
accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis,
demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding
visualization dissemination and information conveyance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of
complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode
planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire
diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework
featuring a Global Expert, a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, and equipped with a
Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall
dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained
on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware
Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty
to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the
Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router,
GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS
outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even
with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate
significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in
Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean. The

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a
research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability
to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is
still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,
quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of
solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by
saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each
tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and
multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel
quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates
spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the
quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a
meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS
video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language
models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific
characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their
reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from
visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique
characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,
the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,
built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K
authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared
images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts
originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of
visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we
introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that
systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by
considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT
achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.</p>

quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to
conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for
streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened
complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues,
we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming.
Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian
deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated
quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and
adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality.
Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the

            <p class="paper-summary">Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a standard tool for computer vision
tasks such as image classification. However, typical model architectures may
result in the loss of topological information. In specific domains such as
histopathology, topology is an important descriptor that can be used to
distinguish between disease-indicating tissue by analyzing the shape
characteristics of cells. Current literature suggests that reintroducing
topological information using persistent homology can improve medical
diagnostics; however, previous methods utilize global topological summaries
which do not contain information about the locality of topological features. To
address this gap, we present a novel method that generates local persistent
homology-based data using a modified version of the convolution operator called
Persistent Homology Convolutions. This method captures information about the
locality and translation invariance of topological features. We perform a
comparative study using various representations of histopathology slides and
find that models trained with persistent homology convolutions outperform
conventionally trained models and are less sensitive to hyperparameters. These
results indicate that persistent homology convolutions extract meaningful
geometric information from the histopathology slides.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is

            <p class="paper-summary">Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children
worldwide, underscoring a critical need for fast and accurate diagnostic tools.
In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual
Networks (ResNets) for automatically diagnosing paediatric pneumonia on chest
X-rays. We enhance interpretability through Bayesian Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual
explanations, and which offers spatial locations accountable for the
decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for
clinical AI deployment.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in
terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur
of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models
do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity.
Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to
perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI),
is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical
deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating
these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are
not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they
are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we
take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a
prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a
"Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human
evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics
used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep
feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to
align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions
to mitigate hallucinations.</p>

we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex
documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and
strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various
depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities.
Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is
supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the

            <p class="paper-summary">Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabeled data from
both known and unknown categories by leveraging knowledge from labeled known
categories. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often
overlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,
when processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in
the image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal
feature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention
Focusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by
pruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective
components: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning
(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple
scales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale
importance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module
that integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational
overhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves
up to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal
computational overhead. The implementation code is provided in

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities
but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation
(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically
via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned
with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation
performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class
collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for
vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with
CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's
gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.
We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier
Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75
datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms
entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA
methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more
stable performance across diverse shifts.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Purpose: This study aims to improve 0.55T T2-weighted PROPELLER lung MRI
through a self-supervised joint reconstruction and denoising model.
  Methods: T2-weighted 0.55T lung MRI dataset including 44 patients with
previous covid infection were used. A self-supervised learning framework was
developed, where each blade of the PROPELLER acquisition was split along the
readout direction into two partitions. One subset trains the unrolled
reconstruction network, while the other subset is used for loss calculation,
enabling self-supervised training without clean targets and leveraging matched
noise statistics for denoising. For comparison, Marchenko-Pastur Principal
Component Analysis (MPPCA) was performed along the coil dimension, followed by
conventional parallel imaging reconstruction. The quality of the reconstructed
lung MRI was assessed visually by two experienced radiologists independently.
  Results: The proposed self-supervised model improved the clarity and
structural integrity of the lung images. For cases with available CT scans, the
reconstructed images demonstrated strong alignment with corresponding CT
images. Additionally, the proposed model enables further scan time reduction by
requiring only half the number of blades. Reader evaluations confirmed that the
proposed method outperformed MPPCA-denoised images across all categories
(Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p<0.001), with moderate inter-reader agreement
(weighted Cohen's kappa=0.55; percentage of exact and within +/-1 point
agreement=91%).
  Conclusion: By leveraging intrinsic structural redundancies between two
disjoint splits of k-space subsets, the proposed self-supervised learning model
effectively reconstructs the image while suppressing the noise for 0.55T
T2-weighted lung MRI with PROPELLER sampling.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
prominent keyword because it is promising in solving complex tasks. The need
for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines
have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the
right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help
of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence
technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the
development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In
this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene
understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to
investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of
several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that
choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the
model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation
allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.
In the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,
mean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are
improved.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The widespread deployment of cameras has led to an exponential increase in
video data, creating vast opportunities for applications such as traffic
management and crime surveillance. However, querying specific objects from
large-scale video datasets presents challenges, including (1) processing
massive and continuously growing data volumes, (2) supporting complex query
requirements, and (3) ensuring low-latency execution. Existing video analysis
methods struggle with either limited adaptability to unseen object classes or
suffer from high query latency. In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system
designed to efficiently handle comp$\underline{L}$ex $\underline{O}$bject
queries in large-scale $\underline{V}$ide$\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to
user queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained
visual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build
an efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding
boxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector
database, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO
transforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate
nearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal
rerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with
detailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates
that LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with
near-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while
significantly reducing index construction costs. This system redefines the
state-of-the-art object query approaches in video analysis, setting a new
benchmark for complex object queries with a novel, scalable, and efficient
approach that excels in dynamic environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for
domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart
comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First,
they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization
to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for
chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying
data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth
chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data
generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart
types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model
to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning
capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we
establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering
at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a
wide range of chart types. The code and data are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of
taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need
for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To
address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive
dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and
facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In
doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of
state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193
websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail
websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:
SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits
to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial
evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less
than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in
lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying
current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore
investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that
a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in
performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from
20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of
the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must
approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for
diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the
subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current
approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect
localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an
uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a
global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity
and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach
employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding
the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression
mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement
strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate
both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three
CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for
kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial
benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive
learning pipeline is implemented. Our code is available at:

methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking</p>

making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The
proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i +
\tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters
$\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our

forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown
great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature
and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network
parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their
practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic
imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image
Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces
three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal
Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction
backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal
coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both
simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast
and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT)
reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior
image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in
ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),
highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.</p>

precision agriculture, enabling early intervention in fertilization, disease,
and stress management. This study presents a deep learning framework for leaf
anomaly segmentation using multispectral imaging and an enhanced YOLOv5 model
with a transformer-based attention head. The model is tailored for processing
nine-channel multispectral input and uses self-attention mechanisms to better
capture subtle, spatially-distributed symptoms. The plants in the experiments
were grown under controlled nutrient stress conditions for evaluation. We carry
out extensive experiments to benchmark the proposed model against the baseline
YOLOv5. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the baseline YOLOv5, with an average Dice score and IoU
(Intersection over Union) improvement of about 12%. In particular, this model
is effective in detecting challenging symptoms like chlorosis and pigment
accumulation. These results highlight the promise of combining multi-spectral

            <p class="paper-summary">Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of

applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in AI-powered surveillance have intensified concerns over the
collection and processing of sensitive personal data. In response, research has
increasingly focused on privacy-by-design solutions, raising the need for
objective techniques to evaluate privacy protection. This paper presents a
comprehensive framework for evaluating visual privacy-protection methods across
three dimensions: privacy, utility, and practicality. In addition, it
introduces HR-VISPR, a publicly available human-centric dataset with biometric,
soft-biometric, and non-biometric labels to train an interpretable privacy
metric. We evaluate 11 privacy protection methods, ranging from conventional
techniques to advanced deep-learning methods, through the proposed framework.
The framework differentiates privacy levels in alignment with human visual
perception, while highlighting trade-offs between privacy, utility, and
practicality. This study, along with the HR-VISPR dataset, serves as an
insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high
metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in
melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual
segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer
variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation
methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the
segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach
leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million
histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the
original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder
segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.
The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the
PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.
Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology
foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational
pathology workflows.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual
perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal
architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual
differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity
patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational
principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common
trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its
transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We
introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining
inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this
framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we
reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two
pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal
stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is
captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing
the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a
convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and
artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated
on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to
enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the
transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account
for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying
the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be
impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors
as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that
utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.
By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR
image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then
applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR
reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our
reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind
SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous
methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling
factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the
effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We have developed a novel CT image analysis package named AnatomyArchive,
built on top of the recent full body segmentation model TotalSegmentator. It
provides automatic target volume selection and deselection capabilities
according to user-configured anatomies for volumetric upper- and lower-bounds.
It has a knowledge graph-based and time efficient tool for anatomy segmentation
mask management and medical image database maintenance. AnatomyArchive enables
automatic body volume cropping, as well as automatic arm-detection and
exclusion, for more precise body composition analysis in both 2D and 3D
formats. It provides robust voxel-based radiomic feature extraction, feature
visualization, and an integrated toolchain for statistical tests and analysis.
A python-based GPU-accelerated nearly photo-realistic segmentation-integrated
composite cinematic rendering is also included. We present here its software
architecture design, illustrate its workflow and working principle of
algorithms as well provide a few examples on how the software can be used to
assist development of modern machine learning models. Open-source codes will be
released at https://github.com/lxu-medai/AnatomyArchive for only research and
educational purposes.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.</p>

real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.</p>

supervised labelling of safety-critical data, which is often impractical in
real-world settings. Recent advances in world models enable reliable prediction
in latent spaces, opening new avenues for scalable and data-efficient safe
control. In this work, we introduce a semi-supervised framework that leverages
control barrier certificates (CBCs) learned in the latent space of a world
model to synthesise safe visuomotor policies. Our approach jointly learns a
neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data,
while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent
dynamics modelling.</p>

to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual

            <p class="paper-summary">Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban
planning, disaster response, and population mapping. Yet accurately segmenting
buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and
high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a
Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net
model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the
urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational
efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of
quantum-assisted Deep Learning frameworks for large-scale building segmentation
in urban environments.</p>

enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models

An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across

            <p class="paper-summary">The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks

approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and

            <p class="paper-summary">Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.</p>

treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow

            <p class="paper-summary">Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution
and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We
present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T
brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172
participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish
BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:
a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial
network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art
3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI
professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T
images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due
to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the
amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually
segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images
that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed
similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive
status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic
T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T
images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising
performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use
cases, and limitations are discussed.</p>

enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.</p>

degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

            <p class="paper-summary">Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper presents an innovative augmented reality pipeline tailored for
museum environments, aimed at recognizing artworks and generating accurate 3D
models from single images. By integrating two complementary pre-trained depth
estimation models, i.e., GLPN for capturing global scene structure and
Depth-Anything for detailed local reconstruction, the proposed approach
produces optimized depth maps that effectively represent complex artistic
features. These maps are then converted into high-quality point clouds and
meshes, enabling the creation of immersive AR experiences. The methodology
leverages state-of-the-art neural network architectures and advanced computer
vision techniques to overcome challenges posed by irregular contours and
variable textures in artworks. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in reconstruction accuracy and visual realism, making the system a
highly robust tool for museums seeking to enhance visitor engagement through
interactive digital content.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision transformer (ViT) models, when coupled with interpretation models, are
regarded as secure and challenging to deceive, making them well-suited for
security-critical domains such as medical applications, autonomous vehicles,
drones, and robotics. However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to
severe consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily
focuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive
the models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model
interpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively
assist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the
vulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined
with interpretation models. We propose an attack called "AdViT" that generates
adversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and
its coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various
transformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that
AdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box
scenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification
confidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76%
misclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate
interpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more
difficult to detect.</p>

in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.
The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on

            <p class="paper-summary">The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

            <p class="paper-summary">Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.</p>

screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for
breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical
structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full
range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative
analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation
algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular
tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and
implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these
structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.
Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,
UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among
them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across
all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,
with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All
model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data
at a later date.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights
from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that
reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored
non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,
and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods
often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single
style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we
advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian
primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style
transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives
tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization
results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian
splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,
extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,
resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced
lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving
flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance
stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing
tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing
with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and
quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its
superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and
editing flexibility.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are

            <p class="paper-summary">The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV

            <p class="paper-summary">Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet
coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the
local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach
quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by
Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a
distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a
connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise
regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates
for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij
spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in
low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even
for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical
findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of
one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled
time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering
unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training
datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is
particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance
varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent
domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training
deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and
anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation
maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen
during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated
effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond
neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray
microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation,
and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key
benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while
discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the
article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to
accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more
accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or
machine learning knowledge.</p>
