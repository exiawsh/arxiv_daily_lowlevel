To extend the\nboundaries of RAVS and facilitate future research in this field, we propose\nOmnimodal Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (OmniAVS), a new dataset\ncontaining 2,104 videos and 61,095 multimodal referring expressions. OmniAVS\nstands out with three key innovations: (1) 8 types of multimodal expressions\nthat flexibly combine text, speech, sound, and visual cues; (2) an emphasis on\nunderstanding audio content beyond just detecting their presence; and (3) the\ninclusion of complex reasoning and world knowledge in expressions. Furthermore,\nwe introduce Omnimodal Instructed Segmentation Assistant (OISA), to address the\nchallenges of multimodal reasoning and fine-grained understanding of\naudiovisual content in OmniAVS. OISA uses MLLM to comprehend complex cues and\nperform reasoning-based segmentation. Extensive experiments show that OISA\noutperforms existing methods on OmniAVS and achieves competitive results on\nother related tasks.",

        "summary": "Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or\nmissing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the\npreparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth\nmargin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683).

Existing approaches to\nreconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,\nsemantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose\nCapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level\nsemantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate\nfeatures without image reconstruction.\n  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating\nstrong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up\nto 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from\nResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis\nfurther reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more\nsemantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,\nwe introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to\nintermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.\nExperimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without\nadditional training costs.",

While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs.

Studying AAA progression and\nrupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged\nwall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a\ndataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are\nextracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are\nobtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,\nas well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately\nestimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary\nconditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to\ndifferent artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added\nduring inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic\nto mesh resolution.

However, these approaches face high\ntraining and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual\ndetails, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a\nnovel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues.

        "summary": "Accurate fetal biometric measurements, such as abdominal circumference, play\na vital role in prenatal care. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound\nimages for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,\nposing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of\ntrained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a\nvision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal\nultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image\nquality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce\nFetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN\nand Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of\n0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed\nfor classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of\n0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal\nultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing\nprenatal care in resource-limited settings.

However, despite\ntheir acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences\noriginating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture\nof the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,\nevent cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a\nunified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point\ncorrespondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By\nformulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a\nconstant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence\nrelation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D\npoints with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its\ngeneral formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing\nmodalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can\neven combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the\neffectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we\nshow consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent\napproaches.

Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant\nlimitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and\nremote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB\nimages to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible\nto environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model\nstability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel\npipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,\ncompensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine\nmorphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the\nsubtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an\nadaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale\nAdaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both\npatch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based\nHybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)\nmodule is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our\ndepth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different\nevaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,\nrespectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we\nintegrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.\nThis integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,\nachieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.",

        "summary": "The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within\nthe biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D\nmicroscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for\nmicroglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.\nExisting segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with\noverlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter\ntuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We\nintroduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia\nsegmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage\napproach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects\nsomas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the\nsame architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,\nrefines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a\n3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:\nself-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch\nSegmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and\nevaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly\nimproves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis\nof complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its\narchitecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and\nastrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.",

However, adversaries may misuse such\ntechniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages\ninto harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work,\nwe take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful\nillusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation\nmodels. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable\nDiffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are\nhateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or\nsubtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate\nthe performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models\n(VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal\nsignificant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection\naccuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs.\nWe further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which\nmainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary\nlayer of information, i.e., hidden messages.

Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as\nusing hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to\nunlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce\nGenerative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first\nmethod to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory\nprediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and\naugments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In\nour framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve\ntail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware\ngeneration method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate\ntrajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike\nprior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the\nfirst to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in\ntrajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,\nArgoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method\nsignificantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on\nhead samples.",

Recent research efforts have\nprogressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the\ninherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic\ncontent and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable\nperformance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these\nlimitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model\ntrained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning\n(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of\ngradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning\nabilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically\nadjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a\ndynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively\nregulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing\nreasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented\nmodels across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,\nlogic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.",

OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,\nleading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised\nsetting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot\nsetting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching\nchallenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by\nthe classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we\nshow that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD\ndetection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD\ncombines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a\nspecific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier\ntrained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is\nmodular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus\nintroduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.\nWe evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also\nconsider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label\nnoise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been\npreviously overlooked.

On this basis, we propose a novel high-resolution\nvideo vasculature segmentation network, dubbed as HRVVS. We innovatively embed\na pretrained visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) model into different layers\nof the hierarchical encoder as prior information to reduce the information\ndegradation generated during the downsampling process. In addition, we designed\na dynamic memory decoder on a multi-view segmentation network to minimize the\ntransmission of redundant information while preserving more details between\nframes. Extensive experiments on surgical video datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed HRVVS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

While many methods compress neural network\nparameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To\naddress this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)\nframework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian\nfunction to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the\ncomputational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we\nintroduce Gr\\\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the\nfractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each\nkernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional\nGaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured\nPruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various\narchitectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent\nmethods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a\n1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%.

In particular, the common approach of\nplacing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a\nglobal control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work\nexplores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture,\nenabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local\ncontrol over the wavefront over the image plane.

To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and\nunderstudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,\nresulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery\nremains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames\nmay mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,\nwe propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that\nintegrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to\ndifferent types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the\nframework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich\npriors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and\ncorruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)\nmodule, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level\ncorruption understanding.

        "summary": "Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level\nmasks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.\nWhile memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation\nparadigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains\ndespite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,\nmemory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly\ncapture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise\npredictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nmemory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for\nmemory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic\ninformation. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel\nand semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism\nto perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their\ninherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local\nAlignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),\nwe achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level\nmemory and the semantic representations in high-level memory.

        "summary": "Task-driven image restoration (TDIR) has recently emerged to address\nperformance drops in high-level vision tasks caused by low-quality (LQ) inputs.\nPrevious TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images\nare degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for\nrestoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most\npowerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help\ngenerate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details\nremains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address\nthis, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior\nto restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging\nuseful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from\npixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we\nemploy a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant\ndetails that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our\nmethod effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing\ntask performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex\ndegradations.",

Recent LiDAR Diffusion\nModels (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for\nimproved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to\nmodel detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological\nconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel\nframework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models\nunder topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our\napproach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph\nrepresentations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers.\nThen we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the\nlatent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology\n(PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world\nglobal topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset\ndemonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving\nimprovements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower\nMinimum Matching Distance (MMD).

RCR-AF\nuniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient\nstability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable\nmonotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity\nthrough built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\\alpha$\nand $\\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,\ndemonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher\ncomplexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness.

A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution\nusing the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of\ngenerative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent\nstochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their\neffectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty.

        "summary": "Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with\ncontextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social\nsituation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of\npredicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event\nlevel emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer\nand S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group\nmembers, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing\nmulti-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions\nprimarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,\nwe extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic\nanalysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims\nto predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and\narousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our\nbenchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses\nholistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on\nVGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further\nresearch. The code and data is available at:\nhttps://github.com/katariaak579/GEMS",

While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a\nnon-invasive approach to capture brain-wide neural dynamics with high spatial\nprecision, decoding from fMRI data -- particularly from task-evoked activity --\nremains challenging due to its high dimensionality, low signal-to-noise ratio,\nand limited within-subject data. Here, we leverage recent advances in computer\nvision and propose STDA-SwiFT, a transformer-based model that learns\ntransferable representations from large-scale fMRI datasets via\nspatial-temporal divided attention and self-supervised contrastive learning.\nUsing pretrained voxel-wise representations from 995 subjects in the Human\nConnectome Project (HCP), we show that our model substantially improves\ndownstream decoding performance of task-evoked activity across multiple sensory\nand cognitive domains, even with minimal data preprocessing. We demonstrate\nperformance gains from larger receptor fields afforded by our memory-efficient\nattention mechanism, as well as the impact of functional relevance in\npretraining data when fine-tuning on small samples.

Motivated by this ability, this paper\nintroduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face\nrecognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized\ncategory discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled\nknown identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen\nIDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high\ncardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD\napproaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method\nthat dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using\nlightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a\nHyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned\non each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle\nidentity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms\nexisting GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face\nrecognition.",

However, existing methods\ntypically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their\nability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we\nintroduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that\ncombines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to\nenable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal\nremote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a\nlarge-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid\nrule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change\ncaptioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question\nanswering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose\nDeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM\nfeatures three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to\ncapture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a\ncross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and\n(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant\ndifference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual\ninstructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large\nlanguage model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize\nefficiency.

Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake\nwithin clinically relevant regions.

However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are\noften constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant\nchallenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although\nincorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial\ndomain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner\nhardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain\ntransferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain\nAdaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA\nleverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with\neach branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists\nof three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)\nself-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on\nunlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by\nself-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between\nclassifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.\nThe collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented\ntarget-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak\naugmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on multi-site T1-weighted MRI data demonstrate that the\nCDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation\nmethods.",

Unlike existing benchmarks that\nfocus on problem solving, our approach centres on understanding student\nsolutions, identifying mistakes, and assigning grades according to fixed\ncriteria. We compile 122 scanned solutions from the Russian Unified State Exam\n(EGE) together with official expert grades, and evaluate seven modern VLMs from\nGoogle, OpenAI, Arcee AI, and Alibaba Cloud in three inference modes.

        "summary": "The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and\ndiagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and\nAge-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows,\nhowever, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and\nresource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and\ninterpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature\nextraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration\nof handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our\nmodel to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features\nfrom retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark\ndatasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for\nGlaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates\nconsistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for\nbinary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the\nIC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\\% accuracy, 94.8\\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,\noutperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,\nour model achieves 83.9\\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive\nperformance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive\nappendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.\nThe model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable\nfor deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results\nposition HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease\nscreening.",

        "summary": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)~\\citep{radford2021learning}\nhas emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual\nrepresentations through contrastive learning. However, CLIP struggles with\npotential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from\nentangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in\ndatasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the\nmodel uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the\nother hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the\nretention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning\ndisentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on\ncertain downstream tasks involving short prompts.\n  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible\nalignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of\ngranularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only\n\\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also\n\\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual\nconcepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \\ours, a novel approach\nthat identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations\nin a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its\ncapability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification\ntheory.

        "summary": "Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven\nby advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on\ncostly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep\nmodels. Furthermore, autonomous systems are increasingly deployed in\nunrehearsed, unstructured environments where no labeled data exists and\nsemantic categories may be ambiguous or domain-specific. Recent zero-shot\napproaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but\ntypically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical\nproperty for robust perception in unstructured environments. To address this\ngap we introduce Frontier-Seg, a method for temporally consistent unsupervised\nsegmentation of terrain from mobile robot video streams. Frontier-Seg clusters\nsuperpixel-level features extracted from foundation model\nbackbones-specifically DINOv2-and enforces temporal consistency across frames\nto identify persistent terrain boundaries or frontiers without human\nsupervision.

        "summary": "Background Brain tumours are the most common solid malignancies in children,\nencompassing diverse histological, molecular subtypes and imaging features and\noutcomes. Paediatric brain tumours (PBTs), including high- and low-grade\ngliomas (HGG, LGG), medulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and rarer forms, pose\ndiagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2\nalone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL\nis feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and\nCC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings\nsupport the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance\nvolumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.",

Despite\nits importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,\nas existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,\nadapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we\nintroduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates\nthe task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)\nfor context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate\nMAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world\nmaps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from\nopen-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each\nlandmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them\ninto prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label\ncoordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall\nperformance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This\nincludes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results\ndemonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific\nretrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated\noutputs with expert cartographic standards.
