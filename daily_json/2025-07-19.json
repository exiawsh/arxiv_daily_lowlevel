        "summary": "We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source\n(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases\nsurpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,\nCLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training\npipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and\na subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features\ninto increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,\nenabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions\nestablish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and\nopen a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for\nthe broader AI community.

        "summary": "Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that\nfollow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their\nsupervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,\nedited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect\nonly prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical\nplausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated\nedit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an\nautomated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,\nresolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative\nmodels and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned\nGemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,\nremoving any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and\ncompositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,\nenabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most\nrepetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training\nwithout human labeling effort. To democratize research in this\nresource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k\nhigh-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses\nall public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source\nfine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our\nexperiments.",

        "summary": "Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for\ndiagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the\nsubtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current\napproaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect\nlocalized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an\nuncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a\nglobal-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity\nand then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach\nemploys evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding\nthe extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression\nmechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement\nstrategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate\nboth contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three\nCT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for\nkidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our\nanalysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial\nbenefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive\nlearning pipeline is implemented.

Existing methods often rely on appearance\nfeatures or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency.

We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves\nas an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D\nreconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected\ndelta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate\ndetections across views.

A delta-neighbor-overlap\nclustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise\nand partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate\nInterquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error\ncriterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on\nsynthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based\nbaselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high\nobject density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it\nwell-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of\nanomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,\nincluding blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the\nUCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,\nBN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method\nresponds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on\nthe algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain\nanonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models\ninadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the\nstrong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.\nThese results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization\nand emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining\ndetection utility.

        "summary": "Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)\ndue to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear\ncomputational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression\ntechnique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision\nMamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we\nfind that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to\nVision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily\nbecause Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most\ntoken reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance\nmeasurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token\nimportance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further\npropose MTR, a training-free \\textbf{M}amba \\textbf{T}oken \\textbf{R}eduction\nframework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our\nmethod can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various\nMamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly\nreduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across\nvarious tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by\napproximately 40\\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\\% drop in ImageNet\nperformance without retraining.",

To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we\nintroduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties\ndirectly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine\nmodels and four tasks.

Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual\ndifferences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity\npatterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational\nprinciple. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common\ntrajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its\ntransformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We\nintroduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining\ninter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this\nframework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we\nreveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two\npathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal\nstream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is\ncaptured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing\nthe specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a\nconvergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and\nartificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.",

DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static\ntoken from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing\nstatic content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates\nthree key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a\ntime-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing\nstatic information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention\nthat routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens\nframe-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual\nstatic-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using\nswap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest\nswap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic\ntransfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.",

While current techniques based on\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing\nnovel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling\nremains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this\nend, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance\nfields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our\nmodel with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us\nto construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and\nfurther enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.\nFinally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.\nExperiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting\nwithout per-scene optimization.

In this paper, we address the limited\nexpressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative\ncapability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted\nby DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to\nenrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we\npropose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature\nextraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global\nsemantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.\nTo effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a\nbidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local\ncues.

        "summary": "Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban\nplanning, disaster response, and population mapping. Yet accurately segmenting\nbuildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and\nhigh resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a\nQuanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net\nmodel in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the\nurban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\nimagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative\nfeature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,\nproving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results\nindicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the\nstandard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.\nThis result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that\nQuanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational\nefficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of\nquantum-assisted Deep Learning frameworks for large-scale building segmentation\nin urban environments.",

However, existing systems often face challenges: high model\ncomplexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,\nunidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and\nrobustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient\nand robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the\nlinear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,\ncombined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among\nmodalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality\nalignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive\nlow-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities\npost-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant\nadaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the\nfusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On\nthe SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower\nerror than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance\nboost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity\nrecognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),\noutperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while\ntraining less than 0.3% of parameters.

        "summary": "Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial\nimages from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in\npreserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been\nincreasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing\nmethods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance\nscale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect\ndegradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,\nresulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose\nDynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any\nblindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry\nimages and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the\nstarting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during\nthe diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce\na dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across\nlocal regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving\nstructural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the\ntrade-off between fidelity and quality.

Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172\nparticipants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish\nBioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:\na specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art\n3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI\nprofessionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T\nimages, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due\nto the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the\namygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually\nsegmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images\nthat were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed\nsimilar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive\nstatus using MRI derivatives (n=3,168).

We extend PE to two-dimensional images and\npropose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction\napproach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,\ndiagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the\ndiscriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image\ndescriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and\nedge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an\nimage. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is\nused to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid\nsearch. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,\nincluding Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers\ncompetitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.\nOur results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a\ncompact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive\nand limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of\nentropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight\nand generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image\nclassification and computer vision.",

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

        "summary": "Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person\nre-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance\nin terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted\nsignificant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms\nprimarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving\nprivacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are\ntypically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera\ndatasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance\nand generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper\nintroduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.\nThe dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,\nwith data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.\nWe also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid\nfoundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on\nour newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian\nattribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for\nperson re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only\neffectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event\nstreams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic\nfeatures. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully\nvalidated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.\nThe benchmark dataset and source code will be released on\nhttps://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID",

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to\ngenerate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.",

To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion\nLikelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of\nintegrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus\nof expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood\nfrom the outliers of the FoE computation.

Unfortunately, dominant approaches\nrely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to\nsharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur\npatterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based\nframework, dubbed \\ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying\ntexture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \\ours performs DM to generate\nthe prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To\nimplement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a\nmemory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for\nDM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the\nTexture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel\nFilter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes\nspatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we\nimplement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture\ndetails.

        "summary": "Emotion recognition in dynamic social contexts requires an understanding of\nthe complex interaction between facial expressions and situational cues. This\npaper presents a salience-adjusted framework for context-aware emotion\nrecognition with Bayesian Cue Integration (BCI) and Visual-Language Models\n(VLMs) to dynamically weight facial and contextual information based on the\nexpressivity of facial cues. We evaluate this approach using human annotations\nand automatic emotion recognition systems in prisoner's dilemma scenarios,\nwhich are designed to evoke emotional reactions. Our findings demonstrate that\nincorporating salience adjustment enhances emotion recognition performance,\noffering promising directions for future research to extend this framework to\nbroader social contexts and multimodal applications.",

        "summary": "The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics\ndemands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially\nfor large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like\nconductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data\nacquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we\nintroduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately\nreconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM\nscans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and\nexperimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow\nimplementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to\ncollect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)\nour SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that\nrequires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).\nSparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in\nMoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of\ncrystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction\nin acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM\nimage. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit\nremarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using\nclassic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward\ntranslating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research\nto industrial fabrication.

        "summary": "Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for\nproviding per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an\nuncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error\ncovariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry\nprocess. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose\na novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)\nper-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such\nas matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,\nour method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the\nMVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering\nto error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a\nrobust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We\nevaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV\nimagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\napproaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.",

Starting from\nstandard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired\nlearning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to\nuse in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired\nlearning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a\nsingle rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of\nbio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on\nCIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on\nImageNet.
